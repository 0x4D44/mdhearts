Title: Stage 2 Refinements, Tuning, and Bench Harness (2025-10-21)

Context
- Stage 2 core is implemented: moon state, suit-void tracking, improved follow-ups, endgame nuance, structured decision logging, env-driven weights, and initial goldens. All tests are green.
- Next we’ll refine heuristics using logs, expand goldens, and add a micro-bench to watch performance while tuning.

Plan
- Heuristic tuning via logs
  - Use `--explain-once`, `--explain-batch`, and `MDH_W_*` to iterate.
  - Targets: moon commit/abort thresholds (control continuity, hearts distribution), and leader-target bias earlier than ≥90 (small, safe positive).

- Follow-up targeting fidelity
  - Consider score gaps and penalties-on-table in `choose_followup_card`.
  - Prefer feeding the scoreboard leader when penalties>0 and provisional winner is leader; soften when leader is safe/no penalties.
  - Add unit tests for multiple-void corners and provisional-winner shifts.

- Planner-level weighting polish
  - In `base_score`, complement follow-up logic with a small positive when our non-capturing play tends to keep the trick with the current leader and penalties>0 (mildly active even <90, guarded by small weight).
  - Gate via new env knob (e.g., `MDH_W_LEADER_FEED_BASE`).

- Performance guardrails
  - Add `benches/heuristic_decision.rs` to measure `explain_candidates_for` across several seeds/seats.
  - Target Normal ≤2–3ms per decision tail in local runs.

- Expanded goldens
  - Early/mid-round lead selection across mixed suits.
  - Leader-target dumps with mixed penalties and near/under 90 score lines.
  - Tight endgames (85–95) validating self-protection vs. targeted feeding.

- Documentation & tooling updates
  - Update README with bench usage and `MDH_W_*` additions.
  - Keep the dev journal current with each tuning pass.

Exit Criteria
- All hearts-app and hearts-core tests green.
- New benches compile and run locally; baseline recorded.
- Added 2–3 new goldens passing across OS/toolchains.
- Logged at least one tuning pass with rationale captured in journal.
