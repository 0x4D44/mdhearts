Hard (Stage 3) — Continuation Tie‑Break Proposal

Context
- In real seeds, Hard’s continuation parts (feed/self/QS/handoff/singleton/next‑hearts) are intentionally tiny. Many mid‑trick cases apply uniform small bonuses (e.g., singleton next lead) across multiple candidates, or base margins are large, so continuation rarely flips the top choice.
- We want Hard to leverage continuation in close calls without destabilizing the overall ranking or Normal goldens.

Goal
- Introduce a conservative, deterministic tie‑break that increases continuation influence only when the base ranking is close.

Design
- Compute per‑candidate `base` and `cont` as today.
- Determine `base_gap = base(top1) - base(top2)` (and optionally to top3).
- If `base_gap <= MDH_HARD_CONT_BOOST_GAP` (default 30–60), apply a small boost to continuation scores before summation for the top‑K candidates in Phase B:
  - `cont' = cont * MDH_HARD_CONT_BOOST_FACTOR` (default 2)
  - Only applied when difficulty=hard; deterministic under step budget; gated by env knobs.
- Preserve monotonic fallback for candidates beyond PhaseB‑topK as before (base‑only), so ordering remains stable when budget hits.
- Early‑cutoff (choose path): consider boosted continuation margin by extending `MDH_HARD_EARLY_CUTOFF_MARGIN` or add a small “cont window” when `base_gap` is within the boost gap.

Knobs
- `MDH_HARD_CONT_BOOST_GAP` (default 40): maximum base gap to enable boost.
- `MDH_HARD_CONT_BOOST_FACTOR` (default 2): scalar for continuation when within the boost gap.
- Printed in `--show-weights`.

Testing & Goldens
- Add constructed mid‑trick golden where base between top two is within 20–40 and continuation favors the more strategic line (feed leader vs self‑capture). Assert Hard flips where Normal does not.
- Verify determinism under step budget; ensure explain path shows boosted continuation and totals consistently.

Performance
- Boost is O(1) arithmetic on already computed continuation; no extra branching.
- Preserve budget/Phase B behavior and stats; no measurable impact expected.

Risks & Mitigations
- Over‑boosting could flip solutions with healthy margins: gated by gap and small factor (2x on tiny values) to keep impact limited.
- Double‑counting with Normal leader‑feed nudge: reasonable given scope; effects are orthogonal (Normal base vs Hard continuation); keep both small.

Implementation Notes (anchors)
- crates/hearts-app/src/bot/search.rs
  - In Phase B continuation aggregation (verbose + choose), after computing `cont`, apply boost when `within_gap`.
  - Thread `within_gap` (computed after base ranking) into the continuation scoring step.
  - Add env reads for new knobs and surface in `--show-weights`.
