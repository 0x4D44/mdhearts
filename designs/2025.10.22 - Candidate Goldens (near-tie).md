# Candidate Goldens — Near‑Tie Mid‑Trick (deterministic seeds)

Purpose
- Capture scenarios where Normal base scores are close and Hard continuation parts (feed vs self‑capture) decide the top choice.

Shortlist (from disagreements CSVs)
- East: 2031 (9S vs AD), 2044 (9S vs 2S), 2075 (JS vs 4S), 2078 (9S vs 4S), 2107 (10S vs KD)
- West: see designs/tuning/compare_west_1000_150_det.csv
- South: see designs/tuning/compare_south_1080_150_det.csv
- North: see designs/tuning/compare_north_1100_200_det.csv

Next step
- For 1–2 seeds above, run:
  - `MDH_DEBUG_LOGS=1 MDH_HARD_DETERMINISTIC=1 MDH_HARD_TEST_STEPS=120 cargo run -p hearts-app -- --explain-once <seed> <seat> hard --hard-verbose`
- Validate that the difference is attributable to continuation (feed>0, self<=0) and construct a stable golden where explain/choose parity holds.
- Add test file under crates/hearts-app/tests (e.g., hard_constructed_midtrick_neartie.rs) mirroring existing patterns.
