Context
- We’re extending the Hard planner with an optional, env‑gated continuation tie‑break that only nudges close base gaps. Defaults are OFF, so CI stability is preserved.
- This complements existing current‑trick rollout and next‑trick probe without changing Normal behavior.

What’s done (this change)
- Added tie‑break knobs (default OFF):
  - MDH_HARD_CONT_BOOST_GAP: base score gap threshold to qualify for a continuation multiplier.
  - MDH_HARD_CONT_BOOST_FACTOR: multiplicative factor applied to continuation when within the gap.
- Applied consistently to choose(), explain_candidates(), and explain_candidates_verbose().
- Surfaced knobs in --show-weights via debug_hard_weights_string().
- Added test hard_continuation_tie_break_golden.rs verifying totals/cont math with and without the boost.
- README updated with the two new knobs.

Plan – Continue Hard Polishing
1) Deterministic/Budget (A)
   - Introduce a lightweight Budget (step and/or time) threaded through choose/explain/rollouts to keep behavior under a predictable cap.
   - Add MDH_HARD_DETERMINISTIC and MDH_HARD_TEST_STEPS for stable CI runs.

2) Adaptive limits + sampling (B)
   - Keep adaptive branch widths and deterministic sampling behind env flags (default OFF); document and add smoke tests.
   - Verify no regressions and maintain explain/choose parity when deterministic mode is ON.

3) Phase‑B top‑K continuation (C)
   - Probe continuation only for top‑K candidates; for the rest, fall back to base to preserve order under tight budgets.
   - Keep default K conservative; expose MDH_HARD_PHASEB_TOPK.

4) Continuation signals (D)
   - Re‑introduce/verify tiny QS exposure risk, control hearts drift, control handoff penalty, and moon relief where applicable.
   - Ensure these are tiny and do not disturb Normal goldens; add unit tests that assert only relative ordering deltas.

5) CLI/Explain polish (E)
   - Make Hard verbose breakdown visible via MDH_DEBUG_LOGS=1; optionally print cont parts when asked.
   - Add CLI flags to pass Hard knobs (mirrors env) for repeatable runs.

6) Goldens/Scans (F)
   - Harvest real disagreements with compare‑batch (deterministic settings) and add a few stable goldens.
   - Add one mid‑trick constructed tie case where the continuation decides the winner (no env needed for CI).

7) Perf checks (G)
   - Keep typical Hard decisions < 20–30ms; add benches and non‑fatal warnings under env thresholds.

Guardrails
- Defaults remain conservative (all extras OFF) to keep CI stable.
- Any default changes must be paired with updated goldens and re‑scanned disagreement CSVs.
