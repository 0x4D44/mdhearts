# Hard vs Normal Tuning Report (2025‑10‑22)

Objective
- Create a clear performance gap (Hard > Normal) using env-only experiments without changing defaults.

Method
- Mixed-seat harness `--match-mixed` with mix=NNHH (North/East=Normal, South/West=Hard).
- Deterministic Hard (MDH_HARD_DETERMINISTIC=1, MDH_HARD_TEST_STEPS=120).
- 150 seeds per seat; average penalties for hard seats vs normal seats (lower is better).

Results
- Baseline: hard_avg=6.48, normal_avg=6.52 (delta=+0.04 in favor of Normal; tie within noise).
- Experiment A (small boosts): FEED_PER=70, SELF_PER=90, TOPK=8, BOOST_GAP=60, BOOST_FACTOR=2, SINGLETON=35, HANDOFF=20 → delta unchanged.
- Experiment B (stronger boosts + cap): FEED_PER=80, SELF_PER=100, TOPK=10, BOOST_GAP=100, BOOST_FACTOR=3, HEARTS_PER=1, HANDOFF=30, CAP=300 → delta unchanged.

Interpretation
- With current integration, Hard’s continuation remains too tiny to change aggregate outcomes across uniform random seeds. The continuation effects do move specific near‑tie cases (as shown by constructed goldens) but do not shift broad averages yet.

Recommendations (next steps)
1) Planner integration: add a small planner-level bias mirroring Hard’s continuation (e.g., leader‑feed on penalty tricks) to reinforce direction while remaining safe.
2) Selective deepening: enable budget‑aware, leverage‑conditioned next‑trick branching (and minimal third‑opponent branch) by default at conservative caps; validate with perf snapshots.
3) Adaptive continuation scaling: increase continuation weights slightly when penalties_on_table>0 and provisional winner is leader; cap via MDH_HARD_CONT_CAP to preserve stability.
4) Evaluation focus: curate seed sets emphasizing mid‑trick decisions and endgame (where continuation matters most) and use `--match-mixed` on these sets to measure deltas.
5) Guardrails: keep deterministic benches and `--match-mixed` summaries in CI as non‑fatal signals; document knobs in README.

Proposed rollout
- Start env-only toggles (no default changes); validate goldens + perf.
- If mixed-seat averages improve (e.g., ≥0.2 pt/hand in curated ranges) and no regressions in tests/goldens, promote tiny default changes in a small PR (weights/biases only).
- Re‑run broad mixed-seat snapshots as a final check before promoting more search depth.
