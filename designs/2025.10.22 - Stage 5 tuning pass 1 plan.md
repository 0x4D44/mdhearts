# Stage 5 — Tuning Pass 1 (deterministic)

Scope
- Use deterministic flags (steps=120, topK=6) to compare Normal vs Hard and shortlist seeds where continuation plausibly improves choices.
- Focus on tiny env-only nudges; do not change defaults until goldens remain stable and match summaries improve.

Artifacts
- Disagreements CSVs:
  - designs/tuning/compare_west_1000_50_det.csv
  - designs/tuning/compare_south_1080_50_det.csv
  - designs/tuning/compare_east_2000_50_det.csv
  - designs/tuning/compare_north_1100_50_det.csv
- Verbose explains:
  - designs/tuning/explain_1145_north_hard_verbose.txt
  - designs/tuning/explain_2022_east_hard_verbose.txt (run if needed)
- Weights snapshot: designs/tuning/weights_snapshot_2025-10-22.txt

Procedure
- For each seat, pick 2–3 disagreements; run `--explain-once <seed> <seat> hard --hard-verbose` with MDH_DEBUG_LOGS=1 and deterministic caps.
- Inspect continuation parts: prefer lines that feed leader (feed>0, self_capture<=0), protect near 100 (self_capture<0), and align with moon relief when active.
- Adjust env-only weights cautiously:
  - `MDH_HARD_CONT_FEED_PERPEN` (±5–10)
  - `MDH_HARD_CONT_SELF_CAPTURE_PERPEN` (±5–10)
  - `MDH_HARD_MOON_RELIEF_PERPEN` (±2–5)
  - Optional caps: `MDH_HARD_CONT_CAP`
- Validate:
  - Re-run disagreement CSVs and spot-check explains.
  - Ensure benches remain within targets; record snapshots in journal.
- If behavior clearly improves and goldens stable, promote new defaults in a follow-up PR.

Next Actions
- Run verbose explains for 2 more seeds (east: 2022/2027; south: 1081/1088) and capture to designs/tuning.
- Try a +5 feed / +5 self_capture adjustment via env; re-run compare-batch and match-batch; log results.
