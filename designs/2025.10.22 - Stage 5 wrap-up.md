# Stage 5 — Wrap‑Up Summary

Status
- Implemented and validated: endgame feed cap golden, Hard moon transition smoke (Considering → Committed), deterministic compare/match tools, verbose explain artifacts, perf snapshots.
- Disagreement scans across 150–200 seeds/seat show stable counts; env‑only +5/+5 continuation nudges did not change counts in sampled ranges.
- All tests pass; goldens stable.

Artifacts
- Tests: `crates/hearts-app/tests/endgame_feed_cap_golden.rs`, `crates/hearts-app/tests/hard_moon_transition_smoke.rs`
- CSVs: `designs/tuning/compare_{west_1000_150,south_1080_150,east_2000_150}.csv`, `designs/tuning/compare_north_1100_200_det.csv`
- Verbose explains: `designs/tuning/explain_{2022,2027}_east_hard_verbose.txt`, `explain_{1081,1088}_south_hard_verbose.txt`
- Perf: bench‑check snapshots captured in journal; weights snapshot written.

Takeaways
- Current Hard continuation weights are conservative and do not materially alter decisions across sampled ranges (good for stability).
- The new tests close key gaps in endgame and moon alignment; no regressions observed.

Open items (deferred/optional)
- Probe/pruning polish (env‑gated) with strict budgets; keep explain path unchanged.
- Additional constructed goldens (mid‑trick near‑ties) if more coverage is desired.

Next Step
- Move to Stage 6 focusing on evaluation breadth and stability guardrails.
