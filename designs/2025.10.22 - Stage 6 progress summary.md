Stage 6 — Evaluation & Stability Progress (2025‑10‑22)

Highlights
- Ran deterministic compare and match batches across four seats and broad ranges.
- Hard ties Normal on average under conservative continuation and step caps (expected), with a handful of stable disagreements harvested.
- Added two constructed near‑tie mid‑trick goldens that validate continuation influence under env‑gated tie‑break.
- Perf snapshots show Hard well within the target envelope.

Key Artifacts
- Compare CSVs (det): designs/tuning/compare_{west_1000_150,south_1080_150,east_2000_150}.csv, compare_north_1100_200_det.csv
- Match CSVs (det): designs/tuning/match_{west_1000_150,south_1080_150,east_2000_150,north_1100_200}_det.csv
- Bench summary: designs/tuning/bench_summary_2025-10-22.md
- Seeds shortlist: designs/tuning/seeds_shortlist_2025-10-22.md
- Near‑tie goldens: hard_constructed_midtrick_neartie.rs, hard_constructed_midtrick_neartie_east.rs

Open Items
- Optional: probe/pruning micro‑tweaks behind env flags; add a small perf guard in benches if we widen caps later.
- Continue to gather disagreements in deterministic mode over time; only promote default changes if goldens remain stable and match summaries improve.
