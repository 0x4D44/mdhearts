# Stage 7 — Polish & Handoff Plan

Goals
- Consolidate results, stabilize defaults, and make evaluation reproducible for others.
- Avoid default logic changes unless justified by goldens and match summaries.

Work Items
- Docs
  - Add a short HOWTO in README for deterministic evaluation using `tools/run_eval.ps1`.
  - Cross-link seeds shortlist and artifacts index from README/docs.
- Tests
  - Add one more endgame constructed golden (non-QS hearts feed to leader) if a clean scenario is easy to craft; otherwise keep as optional.
  - Keep near‑tie goldens gated by env; ensure they clean up env and remain deterministic.
- CI/Guardrails (optional)
  - Add a non-fatal bench check in CI (if CI exists) to print avg/p95 and warn if above loose thresholds.
  - Keep all perf checks informational only.
- Backlog
  - Probe/pruning micro‑tweaks behind env (NEXT3/PROBE_AB_MARGIN) are documented; leave OFF by default pending stronger evidence.
  - Future: revisit continuation weights only if match summaries improve or targeted goldens require it.

Acceptance
- README/doc updates merged; no default behavior changes; tests remain green.
- Evaluation script documented and produces consistent summaries.
