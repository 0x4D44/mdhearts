Goal
- Evaluate Hard-only default determinization (K=3 choose-only; explain deterministic) under deterministic caps across two windows and all seats/mixes. Produce CSVs and a CI-style summary; assess promotion criteria.

Env (deterministic caps + Hard det default)
- MDH_HARD_DETERMINISTIC=1
- MDH_HARD_TEST_STEPS=120
- MDH_HARD_DET_DEFAULT_ON=1
- MDH_HARD_DET_SAMPLE_K=3
- MDH_HARD_DET_PROBE_WIDE_LIKE=1
- MDH_HARD_DET_NEXT3_ENABLE=1

Commands (PowerShell examples)
1) Mixed-seat by seed-file (preferred for curated seeds)
   - mdhearts --match-mixed-file west nnhh --seeds-file designs/tuning/seeds_example.txt --out designs/tuning/mixed_nnhh_west_seeds_detdefk3.csv
   - Repeat for HHNN and seats north/east/south; adjust <mix> accordingly.

2) Mixed-seat wide sweep (two windows; n=1000)
   - mdhearts --match-mixed west 1000 1000 nnhh --out designs/tuning/mixed_nnhh_west_1000_1000_detdefk3.csv
   - mdhearts --match-mixed west 1000 1000 hhnn --out designs/tuning/mixed_hhnn_west_1000_1000_detdefk3.csv
   - Repeat for NHNH/HNHN and seats north/east/south and window 2000.

Summary step (CI markdown)
- Create designs/tuning/mixed_summary_ci_detdefk3_full.md with header:
  seat,mix,window,n,mean,ci95
- For each CSV, compute mean and 95% CI over the penalties column and append as a row.
- Verify that Hard vs Normal means show advantage ≥ +1.0 with CI lower bound ≥ +0.3 across seats/windows.

Promotion criteria (for follow-up PR)
- All goldens (including strict flip) green on CI toolchains.
- Mixed-seat CI meets mean/CI thresholds consistently.
- Bench p95 within target envelopes; no long-tail regressions.

Notes
- Keep explain deterministic; ensure MDH_CLI_POPUPS is unset so outputs go to console/files.
- Do not enable Wide-tier top‑K/nextM or Normal-tier next3 tiny by default; keep env-only until further evidence.
