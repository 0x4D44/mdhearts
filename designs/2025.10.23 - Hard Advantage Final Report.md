Objective
- Achieve a consistent +1–2 pts/hand advantage for Hard vs Normal (2 Hard vs 2 Normal mixed-seat), with stable goldens and no perf regressions.

Work completed
- Bot/search plumbing: deterministic budgets, tiering, continuation parts/cap, determinization scaffold (sampling-only), tiny next3 branching (env-gated), Wide-tier-only env overrides (PhaseB top‑K/nextM), strict flip golden (enabled).
- CLI/tools: explain/compare/json, mixed-seat harness, seed-file support, CI-style summaries; per-candidate verbose, weights snapshots.
- Tests/goldens: broad unit/integration coverage; strict flip golden demonstrates determinization flips a near‑tie with fixed weights.

Evaluation results (deterministic caps)
- Baseline vs K=3/K=5 determinization, Hard-only nudges, Wide-tier top‑K/nextM, tiny next3 (Normal tier):
  - Windows 1000..1999 & 2000..2999; seats N/E/S/W; mixes NNHH/HHNN/NHNH/HNHN; n up to 1000/seat/mix.
  - Across these slices, Hard ≈ Normal in aggregate (means match to 3 decimals in reported windows). See:
    - mixed_summary_ci_full.md (baseline), mixed_summary_ci_detdefk3_full.md (Hard det default K=3)
    - Determinization-on and K=3 summaries under designs/tuning/
    - Wide-tier topK trial: no change in west window 1000..1299 (n=300)
    - Hard-only nudges trial 2: no change in west window 1000..1499 (n=500)
    - Next3 tiny (Normal tier) trial: no change across seats windows 1000..1299 and 2000..2299 (n=300)

Interpretation
- Current continuation weights/caps & shallow lookahead are intentionally conservative to preserve Normal behavior. They successfully flip near‑ties (strict flip golden), but do not move aggregate means across large random windows.
- Determinization K=3/5 under strict budgets keeps sample variance small; helpful for near‑ties, not sufficient to shift aggregates by ≥1 pt/hand.

Recommendation (guarded, staged)
1) Keep Hard default determinization available (MDH_HARD_DET_DEFAULT_ON) for tuning and evaluation; do not promote yet.
2) Trial small, capped changes for Hard choose-only, maintaining explain determinism:
   - A. Slight Wide-tier PhaseB top‑K widen (use MDH_HARD_WIDE_PHASEB_TOPK) with strict cont_cap.
   - B. Minimal next3 selective branching under leverage gates and caps (env-gated).
   - C. Tiny continuation weight bumps within cont_cap (e.g., +5–10% to feed/self‑cap per‑penalty) guarded by env.
   - D. If (A–C) show uplift and goldens remain stable, consider Hard default determinization K=3.
3) Acceptance to promote defaults:
   - Strict flip golden + existing goldens remain green.
   - Mixed-seat CI (n≥1000/seat, 2 windows) shows mean ≥ +1.0 and CI lower bound ≥ +0.3 for Hard vs Normal across seats.
   - Bench p95 within target envelopes; no long-tail regressions.

Next steps
- Run env-only A–C micro-trials on curated seed ranges per seat; record CI summaries.
- If promising, repeat at n≥1000/seat over 2 windows; update goldens only after stability confirmed.
- Prepare a promotion PR (defaults + docs) only when acceptance is met.
