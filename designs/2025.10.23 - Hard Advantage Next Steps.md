Goal
- Achieve a consistent +1–2 pts/hand advantage for Hard vs Normal in mixed-seat evaluations (2 Hard vs 2 Normal), with stable goldens and no regressions.

Current status
- Hard has deterministic budgeting, tiering, continuation parts/cap, determinization (env‑gated), and CLI tools. Full mixed-seat deterministic runs show Hard ≈ Normal under conservative defaults. A constructed determinization test demonstrates totals change in mid-trick; ordering flip not yet guaranteed under tiny defaults.

Approach (guarded, incremental)
1) Golden: determinization near‑tie flip (constructed)
   - Keep existing totals‑change golden; add a second constructed case designed to flip ordering with K>1 and probe widening (env in test). Ensure explain remains deterministic.
   - Acceptance: deterministic flip stable across toolchains; no flakiness under step caps.

2) Tiny Hard‑only nudges (defaults conservative; env‑gated for tuning)
   - Wide‑tier continuation permille boosts (feed/self‑cap) under MDH_HARD_CONT_CAP; defaults remain 0, promote only after eval.
   - Planner nudge (Hard only, Wide tier): tiny leader‑feed per‑penalty nudge when not capturing and leader is provisional winner; strict guards: not first trick, hearts legality intact, unambiguous leader. Keep env‑gated knobs.
   - Acceptance: no Normal golden regressions; Hard goldens stable.

3) Determinization defaults (if needed)
   - Enable small K (e.g., 3) and probe widening by default for Hard only if goldens and perf remain stable; keep explain deterministic.
   - Acceptance: no long‑tail perf spikes; step/time budgets respected; explain/choose parity rules maintained.

4) Evaluation protocol
   - Mixed‑seat (NNHH/HHNN/NHNH/HNHN), all seats, two windows (1000..1999, 2000..2999), n≥1000/seat.
   - Deterministic caps for CI; compute means and 95% CI; promote defaults only if CI lower bound ≥ +0.3 and mean ≥ +1.0 consistently across seats.

5) Guardrails
   - Keep `MDH_CLI_POPUPS` off for CLI automation. Maintain explain determinism; choose‑only deepening/sampling remains budget‑aware.
   - Keep all new behavior behind env (or Hard difficulty) until promotion. Update docs and goldens when promoting.

Milestones
- M1: Add constructed flip golden (determinization); keep totals-change golden. [done]
- M2: Run targeted mixed-seat eval (n=300–500/seat) with conservative and stronger (capped) env nudges; summarize deltas. [partial: multiple smokes show ~no change]
- M3: If still ≈ Normal, trial alternative levers under strict caps:
  - (M3a) Enable small determinization defaults for Hard (e.g., K=3, probe widen); explain remains deterministic.
  - (M3b) Add minimal next3 selective branching for choose-only in tight tiers; keep budgets.
  - (M3c) Slightly broaden PhaseB top‑K only under Wide tier.
  Evaluate with n≥1000/seat per window; CI summary.
- M4: If gains appear and goldens stable, promote tiny defaults; update docs/README, goldens, and journal accordingly.
