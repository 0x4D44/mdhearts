Purpose
- Prepare a cautious PR to promote minimal Hard-only defaults (if approved by results), with guardrails and rollback.

Scope of default changes (proposed)
- Enable determinization by default for Hard choose paths at K=3 with probe widening; explain remains deterministic.
  - Gate remains via env MDH_HARD_DET_DEFAULT_ON=1 for the first PR; promotion to hard-coded default only after CI acceptance.
- Do NOT promote Wide-tier PhaseB top‑K/nextM, tiny next3 (Normal), or continuation bumps in this PR. Keep them env-only for future trials.

Acceptance criteria (must meet before merging defaults)
- Goldens stable: all existing goldens (including strict flip) remain green on CI toolchains.
- Mixed-seat evaluations (deterministic caps):
  - Seats N/E/S/W, mixes NNHH/HHNN/NHNH/HNHN, windows 1000..1999 and 2000..2999, n≥1000/seat/mix.
  - Mean advantage for Hard ≥ +1.0 pts/hand with CI lower bound ≥ +0.3 in aggregate tables.
- Performance: bench-check p95 within documented targets; no long-tail regressions.

PR tasks
1) Code toggle (already merged): det_enabled_for(ctx) + MDH_HARD_DET_DEFAULT_ON gate for Hard.
2) Docs:
   - README: Add a brief section on Hard defaults gate and how to evaluate with CLI.
   - CLI_TOOLS.md: Document --match-mixed-file and seed-file format.
3) Seeds & scripts:
   - Add a seeds file under designs/tuning/ (see seeds_example.txt) and example commands for CI.
4) CI runbook:
   - Deterministic caps ON; run mixed-seat evaluations across both windows; save CSVs and CI-style MD summary.
5) Results review:
   - If acceptance criteria met, flip MDH_HARD_DET_DEFAULT_ON to ON by default (or remove gate) in a follow-up PR.
   - If not met, keep gate OFF and iterate (probe/branching/continuation under caps) via env-only trials.

Rollback plan
- Gate remains env-controlled; revert to OFF instantly by unsetting MDH_HARD_DET_DEFAULT_ON if issues arise.

Notes
- Explain remains deterministic to keep tuning and goldens stable.
- Keep next3 tiny (Normal), Wide-tier top‑K/nextM, and continuation bumps as env-only levers for subsequent PRs after more evidence.
