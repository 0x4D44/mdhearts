Context
- Stage 2–4 complete; Stage 5/6 ongoing. Hard planner has deterministic budget, Phase A/B/C, tiering, continuation parts/cap, probe widening, and determinization scaffold (env‑gated). Mixed‑seat evals show Hard ≈ Normal so far. CLI surfaces exist; tests are green.

Objectives (next 1–2 iterations)
- Achieve a measurable +1.0–2.0 pts/hand advantage for Hard over Normal in mixed‑seat evaluations (2 Hard vs 2 Normal), while keeping Normal stable and performance within budget.
- Maintain determinism and explain/choose parity rules for tuning and CI.

Plan
1) Solidify Telemetry and Help
   - List all Hard flags in `--help` (done in this change).
   - Ensure weights/flags snapshot printed to console and `--out` supports file writes.

2) Determinization (Phase 1 promotion, still conservative)
   - Keep determinization env‑gated; broaden probe under `--hard-det-probe` (choose‑only), leave explain deterministic.
   - Add at least one constructed flipping golden that requires det K>1 (+NEXT3) to flip ranking.

3) Continuation/Tiering Tuning (Hard‑only)
   - Slightly increase Wide‑tier continuation influence (permille boosts) under strict `cont_cap` to avoid destabilization.
   - Keep Normal’s planner unchanged; add tiny Hard‑only planner nudge under Wide tier for clear leader‑feed cases (guards: not first trick, hearts legality, unambiguous leader).

4) Evaluation Protocol
   - Mixed‑seat: NNHH, HHNN, HNHN, NHNH; seats: all four; seeds: two disjoint windows (e.g., 1000..1999 and 2000..2999), n≥1000 per seat.
   - Deterministic mode for CI; record CSV + summary MD with mean and 95% CI. Promote only if CI lower bound ≥ +0.3 and mean ≥ +1.0.

5) Guardrails and Tests
   - Goldens: mid‑trick near‑tie flips (Wide tier and determinization), endgame feed‑cap behavior, moon relief smoke (transitions), AB skip/explain parity.
   - Perf: benches p95 < 20–30 ms under target caps; non‑fatal warn thresholds via env.

6) Contingency (Phase 2)
   - If Phase 1 gain < +1.0, enable small determinization defaults: K=3, probe widen, next3 gated; repeat eval.
   - If still insufficient, consider tiny planner‑level leader‑target nudge outside Wide tier, with strict guards and fresh goldens.

Deliverables
- Updated help text (done), new golden(s), updated journal entries, evaluation CSVs + summaries, and a short report recommending whether to promote defaults.

Notes
- Keep CLI popups off by default (console output only).
- Preserve explain determinism; choose may deepen under tier/det flags.
