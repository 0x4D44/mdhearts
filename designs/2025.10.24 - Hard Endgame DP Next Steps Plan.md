Context
- Tiny endgame DP scoring is implemented for Hard (choose-only), env-gated by `MDH_HARD_ENDGAME_DP_ENABLE` with `MDH_HARD_ENDGAME_MAX_CARDS` (default 3). Continuation remains clamped by `MDH_HARD_CONT_CAP`.

Plan
1) Add constructed goldens
   - ≤3-card endgame flip: Hard prefers feeding the score leader over a safe non-capture in a near-tie; explain unchanged.
   - Parity: ensure explain top ∈ choose top‑K under deterministic caps.
2) Telemetry polish
   - Print `endgame_dp_hits` alongside other Hard stats when `MDH_DEBUG_LOGS=1`.
   - Add a JSON field for endgame hits in `--explain-json` (if not already present).
3) Evaluation (deterministic)
   - Mixed-seat NNHH/HHNN/NHNH/HNNH with DP enabled and conservative caps (e.g., `MDH_HARD_CONT_CAP ≤ 300`).
   - Run n≥1000/seat in two windows (1000..1999 and 2000..2999); write CSVs and summary MD.
   - Gate any default promotion on: all goldens green + mean ≥ +1.0 and CI lower bound ≥ +0.3.
4) Tuning (if needed)
   - Slightly increase DP influence by widening next-trick probe under DP (choose-only) while honoring budget.
   - Keep explain deterministic; no DP in explain path.
5) Docs
   - Fold addendum knobs into CLI_TOOLS.md once encoding issues are resolved; keep README pointers up to date.

Acceptance
- Tests: goldens stable on CI toolchains (Windows/Linux); smoke perf unchanged (no new long-tail spikes).
- Evaluation: DP-enabled Hard shows a measurable aggregate advantage vs Normal under mixed-seat runs with conservative caps.
