Objective
- Enable at least one end-to-end flipping golden (DP OFF vs ON choose()) under current caps (or narrowly scoped endgame-only caps) without heavy base suppression.

Candidate selection
- Prefer harvested seeds where late-endgame legal set is small (2–3) and boosted seeking showed an OFF→ON difference (e.g., west 2120, east 2269).
- Use `--compare-dp-once` to verify a consistent OFF/ON contrast after simulating to ≤3-card hands (deterministic).

Reduction procedure
1) Export snapshot for the candidate seed.
2) Reproduce the late-endgame programmatically (simulate with GameController to target seat).
3) Copy the endgame hand composition (ranks/suits per seat) and construct a direct RoundState in a new test (≤3 cards/hand, hearts broken, seed prior trick to avoid first-trick rules).
4) Scoreboard: make the intended feed target the leader (e.g., North highest total) to align DP continuation signals.
5) Verify under current caps (no base suppression) that choose() differs DP OFF vs ON.
   - If not, allow a narrow, test-local endgame-only cap increase (e.g., MDH_HARD_CONT_CAP=300..400) that does not alter base behavior and is documented inline.
6) Enable the test once DP OFF vs ON difference is robust across toolchains.

Guardrails
- Keep explain deterministic and unchanged; DP is choose-only.
- Do not modify base weights or Normal planner paths for this golden.
- If a small endgame-only cap is required for robustness, keep it documented in the test and scoped via env for the test only.

Artifacts and helpers
- CLI: `--seek-dp-flip`, `--compare-dp-once` (already implemented).
- Examples: designs/tuning/dp_flip_candidates_summary_boosted.csv; snapshot exports under designs/tuning/snapshots/.

Acceptance
- New minimal endgame golden enabled and stable (no flakes on CI toolchains).
- All existing tests remain green; no performance regressions.
