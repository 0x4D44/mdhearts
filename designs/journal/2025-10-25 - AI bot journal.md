- Reviewed current Hard planner status: phases, tiering, determinism/budget, determinization path, and endgame DP hook are implemented; aggregates vs Normal remain ˜0 under conservative caps.
- Wrote next-steps plan focusing on enabling a robust endgame DP flipping golden, deterministic mixed-seat evaluations, and tiny, safe promotions if needed.
- Immediate target: make hard_endgame_dp_minimal_w2120 deterministic under current or narrowly scoped endgame-only cap and enable it; then rerun evaluation matrices and summarize.
