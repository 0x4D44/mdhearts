# Developer Snapshot Tooling

`mdhearts` includes CLI switches to snapshot and reload offline matches for deterministic debugging. See `docs/CLI_TOOLS.md` for full usage.

Future plan:
- Surface these commands in a developer menu / keyboard shortcut once the WinUI host is active.
- Persist last snapshot path & seed in user settings for quicker iteration.
