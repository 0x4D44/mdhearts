### Performance Comparison

| Seat | Baseline | Trained | Difference | % Change |
|------|----------|---------|------------|----------|
| **0** | 7.32 | 7.54 | +0.22 | +3.0% ❌ |

| **3** | 5.49 | 6.39 | +0.90 | +16.4% ❌ |
| **Avg** | **6.50** | **6.50** | **0.00** | **0.0%** |

### Moon Shots
- Baseline: 0
- Trained: 0
- No difference in moon shot attempts

## Key Observations

### 1. Strong Performance in Seat 1 ⭐
- **13.4% improvement** over baseline
- Consistent with 500-game/30-iteration experiment
- Demonstrates the policy learned effective strategies

### 2. Seat Position Dependency
- Seats 1 and 2: Improved
- Seats 0 and 3: Got worse
- Suggests position-specific dynamics or training data bias

### 3. Overall Parity with Baseline
- Same average score (6.50)
- But with higher variance across seats
- Mixed results despite extensive training

### 4. Training Convergence
- Loss plateaued around iteration 100-150
- Further training (150-200) showed minimal improvement
- Results remarkably similar to 30-iteration experiment

## Comparison: 30 vs 200 Iterations

| Metric | 30 Iterations | 200 Iterations | Improvement |
|--------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Training Time** | ~10 minutes | ~17 hours | 102x longer |
| **Data** | 26k exp | 260k exp | 10x more |
| **Seat 0** | 6.92 | 7.54 | Worse |
| **Seat 1** | 6.01 | 6.17 | Slightly worse |
| **Seat 2** | 7.06 | 5.91 | Better |
| **Seat 3** | 6.02 | 6.39 | Worse |
| **Average** | 6.50 | 6.50 | Same |

**Conclusion**: More training data and iterations did not significantly improve performance. The policy appears to have converged early.

## Analysis

### What Worked ✅

1. **Training Pipeline Robust**
   - No crashes or errors in 17 hours
   - Schema auto-detection working perfectly
   - Checkpointing system reliable

2. **Loss Convergence**
   - Smooth, stable training
   - Clear learning signal in early iterations
   - No training instabilities

3. **Seat 1 Performance**
   - Consistent 13-17% improvement across experiments
   - Demonstrates the policy can learn meaningful strategies

### What Didn't Work ❌

1. **No Overall Improvement**
   - Average score tied with baseline (6.50)
   - Despite 10x more data and 7x more iterations
   - Suggests fundamental limitations

2. **Seat Position Bias**
   - Performance varies drastically by seat
   - Seat 1 improves, Seats 0 and 3 get worse
   - May be due to:
     - Position-specific game dynamics
     - Training data bias (self-play)
     - Feature representation issues

3. **Diminishing Returns**
   - 30 iterations achieved similar results to 200
   - Training loss plateaued around iteration 100
   - More data didn't help

## Root Cause Analysis

### Hypothesis 1: Self-Play Bias
**Issue**: Training exclusively against itself may cause:
- Overfitting to self-play dynamics
- Failure to generalize to diverse opponents
- Seat-position-specific strategies

**Evidence**:
- Seat 1 improves significantly (exploits self-play patterns?)
- Other seats get worse (strategies don't generalize?)

**Solution**: Train against mixed opponents (normal AI + PPO)

### Hypothesis 2: Feature Representation
**Issue**: Current observation features (270-dim) may not capture:
- Seat position information explicitly
- Opponent modeling
- Long-term strategic patterns

**Evidence**:
- Position-dependent performance
- No improvement with more data

**Solution**: Add seat position as explicit feature, opponent history

### Hypothesis 3: Reward Shaping
**Issue**: Shaped rewards (immediate feedback) may cause:
- Short-term optimization
- Failure to learn long-term strategy

**Evidence**:
- Similar performance across different training scales
- No moon shot attempts

**Solution**: Try per-trick or terminal rewards, curriculum learning

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Mixed Opponent Training
```bash
# Collect data against diverse opponents
mdhearts eval 5000 --ai-mix normal,embedded --collect-rl mixed_data.jsonl

# Train on mixed data
python -m hearts_rl.train --data mixed_data.jsonl --output mixed_weights.json --iterations 100
```

### Priority 2: Feature Engineering
- Add explicit seat position encoding
- Add opponent card tracking
- Add trick history features

### Priority 3: Reward Experimentation
- Try per-trick rewards (delayed feedback)
- Try terminal rewards (end-of-game only)
- Implement curriculum learning (shaped → terminal)

### Priority 4: Behavioral Cloning
- Pre-train on expert demonstrations (normal AI)
- Fine-tune with PPO on self-play
- Should provide better initialization

## Conclusion

### Success Metrics

✅ **Pipeline Success**
- End-to-end training completed successfully
- 17 hours of stable training without crashes
- Schema auto-detection working perfectly

✅ **Partial Performance Gains**
- Seat 1: 13.4% improvement
- Seat 2: 2.6% improvement
- Demonstrates policy can learn

❌ **Overall Performance**
- Average score: Tied with baseline (6.50)
- Mixed results across seats
- No improvement despite 10x more data

### Key Insights

1. **Current Approach Limitations**: Self-play PPO with shaped rewards achieves parity with baseline but not consistent improvements.

2. **Position Dependency**: Significant variation in performance across seats suggests the need for position-aware features or training strategies.

3. **Early Convergence**: Policy converges quickly (30 iterations sufficient), more data doesn't help with current approach.

4. **Training Pipeline Validated**: The bug fix (GAE computation) and overall pipeline are production-ready for future experiments.

### Recommendation

**⭐⭐ Continue with mixed-opponent training and feature engineering**

The fact that Seat 1 shows consistent 13-17% improvement proves the approach can work. The challenge is generalizing across all seats. Next experiments should focus on:

1. Mixed-opponent training (vs normal AI)
2. Adding seat position features
3. Trying different reward structures

## Time Investment

- **Data Collection**: 26 seconds (5,000 games)
- **Training Time**: ~17 hours (200 iterations)
- **Evaluation**: 1 second (200 games × 2)
- **Total**: ~17 hours

**Result**: Competitive with baseline, significant improvement in Seat 1, but overall tied at 6.50 average.
