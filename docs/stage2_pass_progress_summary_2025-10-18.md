# Stage 2 Passing Progress Summary — 2025-10-18

## Recent Progress
- **Premium left-pass guard:** `enumerate_pass_triples` now enforces a hard guard that replaces illegal left passes with Ten+ heart alternatives, covering Ace/King and Q♠ cases. Replacement logic enumerates all viable Ten+ substitutions before scoring.
- **Regression coverage:** Added dedicated fixtures for hands 75/153/242/432/461/498/511/681/757/767/912 (`crates/hearts-core/tests/pass_hard_guard.rs`) to assert that the optimizer either keeps premium hearts home or ships three Ten+ hearts when moon urgency is high.
- **Benchmark results:** Latest run `stage2_pass_moon_v045_handshake17` delivered **97.24 %** block success (1 938 / 1 993). Nine inverted moons remain; six premium-heart clusters plus the heart+club anchor and two off-suit dumps carrying large penalties (see `docs/stage2_block_failure_analysis_handshake17.md`).
- **Artifacts updated:** Generated `docs/benchmarks/stage2_block_failures_handshake17.md`, refreshed aggregate summaries (`docs/benchmarks/stage2_pass_moon_runs.csv` / `.json`), and captured new telemetry under `bench/out/stage2_pass_moon_v045_handshake17/`.

## Next Steps
1. Prototype targeted overrides for the remaining failures (153/432/461/498/567/681/757/890/912) so the optimizer splits premium hearts or injects Ten+ support where penalties alone are insufficient.
2. Capture belief telemetry for the residual cases to validate urgency thresholds before the next retune.
3. Prepare a Windows acceptance sweep (`cargo test --workspace`) and plan an A/B benchmark (pass_v2 vs pass_v1) once these overrides land.
