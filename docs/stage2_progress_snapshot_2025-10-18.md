# Stage 2 Progress Snapshot — 2025-10-18

## Summary of Recent Work
- Hardened the left-pass guard so high-urgency passes that include A♥/K♥ or Q♠ are replaced with Ten+ heart alternatives; fallback logic now enumerates all valid substitutions before scoring.
- Added regression fixtures for the 11 high-risk hands surfaced by handshake23 to ensure illegal combinations never reappear in `enumerate_pass_triples`.
- Ran the updated Stage 2 benchmark (`stage2_pass_moon_v045_handshake17`) and published the refreshed telemetry/failure artefacts under `bench/out/` and `docs/benchmarks/`.

## Current Status
- Latest run handshake17: **97.24 %** block success (1,938 / 1,993). Nine inverted moons remain; the premium clusters persist alongside the heart+club anchor and two penalised off-suit dumps (hand 890).
- Average candidate count sits at 29.7 with a 6.3 best-vs-next margin, so search depth is stable while the guard filters combinations more aggressively.

## Next Steps
1. Prototype targeted overrides for the remaining failures (153/432/461/498/567/681/757/890/912) so premium hearts are shared more reliably.
2. Capture belief telemetry for those hands to confirm the defensive urgency trigger points before another retune.
3. Stage a Windows acceptance sweep and prep cross-version benchmarks once overrides are in place.
