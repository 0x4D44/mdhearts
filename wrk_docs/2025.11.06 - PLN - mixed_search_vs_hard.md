# Plan: Mixed-Seat Search vs Hard Evaluation

_Last reviewed: 2025-11-06 09:30 CT_

## Objective
Measure SearchLookahead performance when sharing the table with FutureHard (or Normal) seats rather than mirrored copies. Capture per-seat penalty deltas, disagreement rates, and telemetry behaviour in mixed scenarios.

## Stage 0 – Baseline & Assumptions
1. Define mixes (e.g., `shsh` = Search/Hard/Search/Hard) and target think limits (5s, unlimited).
2. Metrics: per-seat averages/std-devs, score differentials, disagreement counts, telemetry fallback stats.

## Stage 1 – Harness Validation
- Confirm CLI support (`--match-mixed`, `--match-mixed-file`, `search`/`lookahead` tokens, `--telemetry-out`).
- Decide if mixed commands should expose telemetry export; adapt scripts if needed.

## Stage 2 – Automation
1. Extend `tools/run_search_vs_hard.ps1` or add a sibling script:
   - Parameters for mixes, seed ranges, counts, think limits.
   - Optional telemetry smoke (1 ms cap on a Search seat) per run.
2. Validate with a 5-seed smoke (per mix) before large batches.

## Stage 3 – Data Collection
1. Smoke run: `--match-mixed <seat> <seed_start> 5 shsh --out … --stats` + telemetry.
2. Full run: e.g., 200 seeds per mix; capture CSVs + telemetry to timestamped folder (`designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/<timestamp>/`).

## Stage 4 – Analysis
- Compute per-seat averages/std-devs; compare Search vs Hard seats.
- Inspect disagreement CSVs (if any) to understand decision-level differences.
- Summarize telemetry (timeouts, fallback distribution) in mixed context.
- Document findings (tables + narrative).

## Stage 5 – Extension Matrix
- Repeat for other mixes (Search vs Normal, 3v1 scenarios, seat permutations).
- Consider random seat rotations to check positional effects.

## Stage 6 – Reporting
- Fold results into Stage 5/6 docs (README, experiment write-up).
- Highlight implications (Search advantage size, stability, telemetry health).
- Outline follow-up experiments (depth caps, branch tuning, etc.).

## Immediate Next Actions
1. Update/clone the batch script to drive `--match-mixed` runs with mixes like `shsh`.
2. Run a 5-seed smoke to confirm command + telemetry wiring.
3. Launch the full mixed-seat batch once smoke passes; proceed to analysis.
