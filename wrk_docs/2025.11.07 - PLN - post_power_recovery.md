# Plan: Power Recovery - Search vs Hard & Mixed Seat

_Generated: 2025-11-07 09:30 CT_

## Situation Snapshot
- Stage 4 of the think-limit study finished on 2025-11-06 (artifacts under `designs/tuning/search_vs_hard/2025-11-06_090614/`), but Stage 5 analysis + Stage 6 reporting still open.
- Mixed-seat Search vs Hard evaluation plan (2025-11-06) is drafted yet no automation or data exists.
- CLI/telemetry updates landed (think-limit flags, `--telemetry-out`, timeout smokes) but documentation/README changes are only partially reflected and need polish before sharing externally.

## Goals (Next 48h)
1. Close the think-limit report (analysis + publishable summary) without rerunning 800-seat batches.
2. Bring mixed-seat harness to parity with the single-seat script and capture at least one 5-seed smoke.
3. Align public docs (README, CLI tools, architecture set) so new flags + telemetry work are discoverable.

## Task Board

### A. Think-Limit Study Wrap (Stage 5/6)
- [ ] Recompute per-cap stats (avg/sigma, disagreement rate, timeout counts) by parsing the existing CSV/summary files; drop results into a Stage 5 Markdown (`wrk_docs/2025.11.07 - RPT - search_vs_hard_stage5.md`).
- [ ] Summarize telemetry smokes (counts + fallback mix) and link evidence paths in the report.
- [ ] Update README + CLI docs with the final narrative snippet and cross-link to `ARCHITECTURE.md` + the new report before preparing the Stage 6 PR notes.

### B. Mixed-Seat Harness Bring-up
- [ ] Clone/extend `tools/run_search_vs_hard.ps1` to accept `-Mixes`/`-SeedsFile` and wire `--match-mixed` plus telemetry capture.
- [ ] Generate a 5-seed smoke per mix (start with `shsh`), verify CSV + telemetry integrity, and stash artifacts under `designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/<timestamp>/`.
- [ ] Once smoke passes, schedule the 200-seed full run and note runtime expectations in the plan doc.

### C. Documentation Readiness
- [ ] Finish `ARCHITECTURE.md` pass (typo/encoding cleanup) and ensure README links render (emoji placeholders currently broken).
- [ ] Back-port the CLI changes into `docs/CLI_TOOLS_ADDENDUM.md` or consolidate into the primary CLI doc so `--telemetry-out` / think-limit flags are all in one place.
- [ ] Capture a short changelog-style summary in `wrk_journals` after completing A/B to prevent future recovery ambiguity.

## Risks / Watchouts
- Stage 5 analysis currently manual; build a quick parser (Python or PowerShell) to avoid hand-edit mistakes.
- Mixed-seat automation may multiply runtime; cap to 5-seat smokes until telemetry proves stable.
- README encoding glitches (emojis) could block reviews; factor time for a cleanup pass alongside the documentation tasks.
