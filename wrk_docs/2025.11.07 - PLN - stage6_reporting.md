# Plan: Stage 6 Reporting Prep

_Generated: 2025-11-07 10:35 CT_

## Objectives
1. Publish Stage 5 findings (think-limit + mixed-seat) in repo docs/PR notes.
2. Prepare Stage 6 narrative (impact, risks, follow-ups) for review/PR.
3. Ensure telemetry artifacts + scripts are referenced for reproducibility.

## Tasks
- [ ] Finalize Stage 5 report wording (interpretation, links to JSON caches, highlight zero disagreements + next steps).
- [ ] Draft Stage 6 summary (1-2 pages) covering outcomes, risks, and future experiments; attach to wrk_docs or designs.
- [ ] Update README/CLI docs once more if additional mixes/scripts land; ensure encoding issues resolved.
- [ ] Prep PR checklist: include script changes, docs updates, Stage 5 report, mixed-seat data links, journals.
- [ ] Run lint/format + targeted tests (CLI parser, telemetry tests) before handoff.

## Dependencies
- Analyzer outputs in `tmp/search_vs_hard_stage5/analysis.json` and `tmp/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-07_103451.json`.
- Telemetry artifacts from both mirrored and mixed runs.

## Risks
- Disagreement data still pending; need follow-up run with randomized configs.
- Mixed-seat coverage currently limited to shsh; Stage 6 summary must call this out.

## Owners
- Primary: outage recovery lead.
- Reviewers: AI evaluation stakeholders.
