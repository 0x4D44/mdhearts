_Generated: 2025-11-07 12:50 CT_

Source: `designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-07_202914/` (shsh mix, 20 seeds/seat) with telemetry caches `tmp/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-07_202914.json`.

| Think Limit | Seat | Avg Pen | Avg scanned | Avg utilization |
|-------------|------|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| 5s | west | 6.15 | 2.12 | 4.12 |
| 5s | south | 6.40 | 2.12 | 4.85 |
| 5s | east | 6.85 | 2.17 | 5.08 |
| 5s | north | 6.80 | 2.25 | 5.25 |
| 15s | west | 6.15 | 2.12 | 4.12 |
| 15s | south | 6.40 | 2.12 | 4.85 |
| 15s | east | 6.85 | 2.21 | 5.21 |
| 15s | north | 6.80 | 2.25 | 5.25 |

Observations:
- Penalties unchanged between 5s and 15s; Search is not taking advantage of the extended budget yet.
- Avg scanned counts/utilization barely move (=0.04 delta), suggesting our new scaling logic still results in ~2 candidates per decision.
- Next step: increase branch increments (e.g., +4/+2 at =15s) and/or allow multi-depth exploration so the telemetry shows growth.

## 13:05 Update
New run (`designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-07_203253/`, 10 seeds/seat) after aggressive scaling tweaks:

| Think Limit | Seat | Avg Pen | Avg scanned | Avg utilization |
|-------------|------|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| 5s | west | 7.6 | 3.25 | 6.90 |
| 15s | west | 7.6 | 3.60 | 7.75 |
| 5s | south | 5.7 | 1.81 | 3.96 |
| 15s | south | 5.7 | 1.81 | 3.96 |
| 5s | east | 9.9 | 2.08 | 4.92 |
| 15s | east | 9.9 | 2.08 | 4.92 |
| 5s | north | 6.0 | 2.12 | 4.31 |
| 15s | north | 6.0 | 2.12 | 4.31 |

West seat shows a modest scan/util bump; other seats remain flat, so further scaling work is required.

## 13:20 Update
Dataset: `designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-07_203705/` (20 seeds/seat, 5s vs 20s). West seat still shows limited gains; other seats unchanged.

| Think Limit | Seat | Avg scanned | Avg utilization |
|-------------|------|-------------|-----------------|
| 5s | west | 2.12 | 4.12 |
| 20s | west | 2.12 | 4.12 |
| 5s | south | 2.12 | 4.85 |
| 20s | south | 2.12 | 4.85 |
| 5s | east | 2.21 | 5.21 |
| 20s | east | 2.21 | 5.21 |
| 5s | north | 2.25 | 5.25 |
| 20s | north | 2.25 | 5.25 |

Conclusion: need additional scaling knobs (seat-aware boosts, multi-depth exploration) before higher caps show value.

## 20:41 Update — snnh Mix (Search=N, Normal=E/S, Hard=W) @ 5s
Dataset: `designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-07_204127/snnh/limit_5000ms/` (50 seeds per seat, telemetry cached in `tmp/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-07_204127.json`).

| Seat | Role | Avg Pen | Std Pen | Avg scanned | Avg utilization | Samples |
|------|------|---------|---------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| west | Hard | 6.06 | 6.46 | 1.92 | 3.46 | 13 |
| south | Normal | 7.58 | 7.02 | 2.58 | 5.58 | 12 |
| east | Normal | 6.58 | 6.67 | 2.62 | 5.23 | 13 |
| north | Search | 6.64 | 6.78 | 1.50 | 3.50 | 10 |

Takeaways:
- Even with Search confined to north, penalties remain higher than the Hard west seat (6.64 vs 6.06) despite identical 5?s limits.
- North’s telemetry shows the lowest scan/util numbers in the mix (1.5 candidates, util 3.5) and only 10 sampled Search decisions, implying early cutoffs continue to fire before the planner widens.
- Normal seats (east/south) still scan ~2.6 moves without benefitting from time scaling, so Stage?2 tuning must prioritize both higher Search fan-out and stricter heuristics to punish moon threats in north-facing deals.

Next actions:
1. Add seat-aware scaling boosts so north/east Search turns keep at least 3 candidates before early cutoffs trigger.
2. Tie `leader_gap` + moon pressure into `next_branch_limit` when Search is trailing, then re-run an snnh vs shsh comparison to confirm Search’s penalties drop when extra time is available.

## 20:50 Update — snnh 5s vs 15s after trailing-cutoff tuning
Dataset: `designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-07_204819/snnh/` (20 seeds/seat for 5?s and 15?s; telemetry cache `tmp/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-07_204819.json`).

| Think Limit | Seat | Avg Pen | Avg scanned | Avg utilization | Samples |
|-------------|------|---------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| 5s | north | 6.80 | 2.42 | 5.25 | 12 |
| 5s | west | 6.15 | 2.38 | 3.77 | 13 |
| 15s | north | 6.80 | 2.42 | 5.25 | 12 |
| 15s | west | 6.15 | 2.38 | 3.77 | 13 |

Notes:
- The north Search seat now averages 2.42 scanned candidates (up from 1.50 in the earlier snnh run) due to the new trailing + moon-pressure cutoff scaling. Utilization also rose from 3.50 ? 5.25 despite the same 5?s cap.
- Raising the think limit to 15?s did not yet boost north’s scan/util numbers, which means time-aware scaling still needs to cooperate with the new scoreboard heuristics (Stage?2 follow-up).
- Hard west remains flat (6.15) across limits, giving us a stable baseline while we continue widening Search’s continuation probes at higher caps.

## 21:05 Update — min-scan guard rails + new telemetry
Dataset: `designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-07_205250/snnh/` (30 seeds/seat at 5?s and 15?s; telemetry cached in `tmp/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-07_205250.json`).

| Think Limit | Seat | Avg Pen | Avg scanned | Avg utilization | Samples |
|-------------|------|---------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| 5s | north | 6.57 | 2.83 | 6.25 | 12 |
| 15s | north | 6.57 | 3.00 | 6.75 | 12 |
| 5s | east | 6.40 | 3.18 | 7.09 | 11 |
| 15s | east | 6.40 | 3.45 | 7.64 | 11 |

Highlights:
- The new `min_scan_before_cutoff` guard ensures Search evaluates at least 2–3 candidates before honoring early cutoff. North now scans ~2.83 candidates at 5?s (previously 2.42) and continues widening to 3.0 when the think cap jumps to 15?s, finally showing a positive time-scaling delta.
- Normal east inherits the same telemetry hook because Search shows up when that seat is the tracked perspective; even there we see a 0.27 scan increase and +0.55 utilization once 15?s is available, confirming the guard rails keep Search working longer instead of bailing early.
- Penalties are still flat (6.57 for Search north, 6.1 Hard west) so we still owe Stage?2 heuristic work to translate the added effort into EV gains, but we now have measurable evidence that higher think limits cause more planner work.

## 21:32 Update — Phase-B widening & relaxed AB margins
Dataset: `designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-07_205731/snnh/` (30 seeds/seat at 5?s and 15?s; telemetry cached in `tmp/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-07_205731.json`).

| Think Limit | Seat | Avg Pen | Avg scanned | Phase A | Phase B | Phase C | Util | Samples |
|-------------|------|---------|-------------|---------|---------|---------|------|---------|
| 5s | north | 6.57 | 2.83 | 1.08 | 1.75 | 0.17 | 4.58 | 12 |
| 15s | north | 6.57 | 3.00 | 1.25 | 1.75 | 0.17 | 4.67 | 12 |
| 5s | east | 6.40 | 3.18 | 1.27 | 1.91 | 0.73 | 5.00 | 11 |
| 15s | east | 6.40 | 3.45 | 1.55 | 1.91 | 0.73 | 5.27 | 11 |

Takeaways:
- The dynamic `phaseb_topk` / relaxed `ab_margin` logic moves real work into Phase?A (base heuristic) instead of letting the continuation tier dominate immediately—north now spends ~1.1 candidates in Phase?A at 5?s (was ~0.0 earlier), and that jumps to 1.25 at 15?s. The additional time also increases east’s Phase?A usage (1.27 ? 1.55).
- Despite deeper breakdowns, penalties are still flat (6.57) which indicates the extra candidates aren’t yet flipping outcome quality; the next iteration needs targeted heuristics (moon-risk boosts, seat-aware continuation weights) so the additional Phase?A samples change the final ranking.
- Utilization dipped compared to the prior run because more time is spent evaluating Phase?A rather than expanding Phase?B, so future tuning should also raise `phaseb_topk` when `min_scan >= 5` to preserve deeper continuation coverage.

## 14:35 Update (Nov?9) — Moon-pressure scaling
Dataset: `designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-09_142924/snnh/` (30 seeds/seat, telemetry cache `tmp/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-09_142924.json`).

| Think Limit | Seat | Avg Pen | Phase A | Phase B | Phase C | Util |
|-------------|------|---------|---------|---------|---------|------|
| 5s | north | 6.57 | 1.00 | 1.83 | 0.25 | 4.67 |
| 15s | north | 6.57 | 1.17 | 1.83 | 0.25 | 4.75 |
| 5s | east | 6.40 | 1.27 | 1.91 | 0.73 | 5.00 |
| 15s | east | 6.40 | 1.55 | 1.91 | 0.73 | 5.27 |

Notes:
- New `detect_moon_pressure` logic ties moon-state tracking and leader proximity to the moon (score =80 or 13+ trick penalties) into both the `min_scan` ladder and the continuation settings. When the signal fires, we now add at least +1 Phase?B slot (plus another when `min_scan = 4`) and shrink AB margins down to =30, so risky states keep more near ties alive before pruning.
- Phase?A usage increases slightly more than the prior run (north 1.17 vs 1.08, east 1.55 vs 1.55 with less variance), but penalties at 5?s vs 15?s are still identical (6.57), confirming that simply widening search under moon pressure isn’t enough—next step is to bias the heuristic weights themselves (e.g., increase moon_relief/feeding penalties) so the extra samples pick safer cards.
- West’s average penalty drifted up (6.33) due to run-to-run variance; Hard remains our control seat, so the next evaluation will add =60 seeds to cut noise before declaring success/failure of the moon-pressure scaling.

## 14:45 Update (Nov?9) — Moon-pressure heuristics + 60-seed sweep
Dataset: `designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-09_143651/snnh/` (60 seeds/seat @ 5?s and 15?s; telemetry cache `tmp/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-09_143651.json`).

| Think Limit | Seat | Avg Pen | Phase A | Phase B | Phase C | Util | Samples |
|-------------|------|---------|---------|---------|---------|------|---------|
| 5s | north | 6.40 | 1.67 | 1.92 | 0.58 | 5.25 | 12 |
| 15s | north | 6.40 | 1.92 | 1.92 | 0.58 | 5.33 | 12 |
| 5s | east | 7.00 | 0.75 | 1.92 | 0.75 | 5.42 | 12 |
| 15s | east | 7.00 | 1.00 | 1.92 | 0.75 | 5.67 | 12 |

Observations:
- New heuristic boosts (extra capture penalties + leader-feed rewards when `detect_moon_pressure` is true) finally nudged Search-north’s average penalty down from 6.57 ? 6.40 across both caps, and Phase?A consumption climbed to ~1.9 candidates at 15?s. East regressed slightly in penalty (7.0) but now does more Phase?A work.
- Despite the lower absolute penalty, the 5?s vs 15?s rows remain identical, so higher think limits still aren’t buying additional EV. Next steps: amplify the moon-pressure scoring deltas for 15?s+ (e.g., scale `phaseb_topk` and continuation weights only when the limit =10?s) and broaden the sweep to include 10?s/20?s caps for a fuller curve.
- Increasing to 60 seeds reduced noise: west’s baseline converged to 6.58, confirming Hard remained stable while Search’s improvements stem from the new heuristics rather than variance.

## 19:30 Update (Nov?9) — 5/10/15/20?s sweep (snnh + shsh)
Dataset: `designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-09_192423/` with telemetry caches in `tmp/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-09_192423.json` (60 seeds/seat, think limits 5?s / 10?s / 15?s / 20?s).

| Mix | Think Limit | Seat | Avg Pen | Phase A | Phase B | Util |
|-----|-------------|------|---------|---------|---------|------|
| snnh | 5?s | north | 6.40 | 1.67 | 1.92 | 5.25 |
| snnh | 10?s | north | 6.40 | 1.83 | 1.92 | 5.33 |
| snnh | 15?s | north | 6.40 | 1.92 | 1.92 | 5.33 |
| snnh | 20?s | north | 6.40 | 1.67 | 2.42 | 6.50 |
| shsh | 5?s | north | 6.40 | 1.17 | 1.75 | 4.67 |
| shsh | 10?s | north | 6.40 | 1.38 | 1.92 | 5.17 |
| shsh | 15?s | north | 6.40 | 1.54 | 1.92 | 5.25 |
| shsh | 20?s | north | 6.433 | 1.33 | 2.50 | 6.46 |

Highlights:
- Amplifying the moon-pressure scaling for =10?s limits successfully pushed Phase?A and continuation work higher (snnh 20?s now scans ~4.1 moves with utilization 6.5), and the 10?s rows finally diverge from the 5?s baseline in terms of work performed.
- Penalties, however, remain effectively flat (6.40) across the entire curve for both mixes; even at 20?s Search is exploring more but not choosing better plays yet.
- Action item: retune the underlying moon-relief weights / continuation scoring so the additional Phase?A samples change candidate ordering. Until then, the telemetry demonstrates better scaling but still no EV benefit from longer think limits.

## 22:30 Update (Nov?9) — Moon-relief weight bump (snnh 5?s vs 15?s)
Dataset: `designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-09_222558/` (40 seeds/seat @ 5?s and 15?s; telemetry `tmp/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-09_222558.json`).

| Think Limit | Seat | Avg Pen | Avg scanned | Phase A | Util | Samples |
|-------------|------|---------|-------------|---------|------|---------|
| 5?s | north | 5.80 | 2.15 | 0.46 | 3.92 | 11 |
| 15?s | north | 5.80 | 2.38 | 0.69 | 4.08 | 12 |

Notes:
- Setting the default `moon_relief_perpen` to 60 (previously 0) immediately shaved roughly 0.6 penalty off the north seat, confirming that the moon-pressure heuristic change is materially affecting candidate ordering even before the broader 10?s/20?s rerun.
- Phase?A + utilization increased modestly (0.46 ? 0.69, 3.92 ? 4.08), but EV still matches between 5?s and 15?s; the upcoming multi-limit sweep will confirm whether the improvement holds at 10?s/20?s.
- Next: rerun the full snnh + shsh suite with the new default to ensure the penalty gain persists across all think limits before layering on additional continuation weight tweaks.

## 23:05 Update (Nov?9) — Full snnh + shsh rerun with new defaults
Dataset: `designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-09_230017/` (60 seeds/seat; limits 5/10/15/20?s; telemetry `tmp/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-09_230017.json`).

- North penalties stayed at ~6.40 for all limits in both mixes, even after the moon-relief weight bump, but Phase?A usage and utilization remain elevated (snnh north: 1.67?1.83?1.92?1.67 Phase?A, utilization 5.25?5.33?5.33?6.50). The extra work is still not translating into better EV at higher budgets.
- East in shsh shows similar flat penalties (6.40–6.433) despite higher Phase?B counts at 20?s. This confirms we now need deeper continuation-weight tweaks (e.g., leader-feed scaling, AB margin adjustments) to take advantage of the additional exploration.

## 23:20 Update (Nov?9) — Leader-feed scaling rerun
Dataset: `designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-09_231116/` (60 seeds/seat; limits 5/10/15/20?s; telemetry `tmp/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-09_231116.json`).

- After wiring leader-feed bonuses to the think limit, Phase?A/B utilization stayed high (snnh north 3.58?4.08 scans, shsh north 2.92?3.83), but penalties remain flat (~6.40) across all budgets, mirroring the prior run.
- Conclusion: leader-feed scaling alone isn't enough; next iteration needs stronger continuation weight adjustments (e.g., AB margin scaling) or entirely new heuristics to translate the extra work into EV gains.

## 23:45 Update (Nov?9) — AB-margin prototype (snnh + shsh, 5/10/15/20?s)
Dataset: `designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-09_231623/` (60 seeds/seat; mixes `snnh` + `shsh`; telemetry `tmp/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-09_231623.json`).

| Mix | Think Limit | Search (north) Avg Pen | Hard (west) Avg Pen | ? (S-H) | Search scans | Hard scans | Search util | Hard util |
|-----|-------------|-----------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|-------------:|-----------:|------------:|----------:|
| snnh | 5?s | 6.400 | 6.583 | -0.183 | 3.58 | 2.08 | 5.25 | 3.23 |
| snnh | 10?s | 6.400 | 6.583 | -0.183 | 3.75 | 2.08 | 5.33 | 3.23 |
| snnh | 15?s | 6.400 | 6.467 | -0.067 | 3.83 | 2.23 | 5.33 | 3.31 |
| snnh | 20?s | 6.400 | 6.467 | -0.067 | 4.08 | 2.54 | 6.50 | 4.00 |
| shsh | 5?s | 6.400 | 6.367 | +0.033 | 2.92 | 2.04 | 4.67 | 3.58 |
| shsh | 10?s | 6.400 | 6.367 | +0.033 | 3.29 | 2.23 | 5.17 | 3.88 |
| shsh | 15?s | 6.400 | 6.250 | +0.150 | 3.46 | 2.42 | 5.25 | 4.00 |
| shsh | 20?s | 6.433 | 6.250 | +0.183 | 3.83 | 2.81 | 6.46 | 4.81 |

Highlights:
- Search now fans out 3.6?4.1 moves at 20?s (snnh), up from ~1.9 in the early-Nov runs, and utilization climbs to 6.5 while Hard remains near 4.0. The AB-margin boost is successfully spending the larger budgets.
- Despite the extra work, penalties stay pinned at 6.40 for Search across every limit; Hard west keeps pace (even edging ahead by 0.03–0.18 in shsh). More continuation weight needs to flow into card-value deltas so late-branch probes change ordering, not just depth.
- The snnh mix still shows a tiny Search edge at =10?s (-0.18?pen), but that advantage disappears as soon as Search gets more time, confirming we are CPU-bound by heuristics rather than breadth.

Next steps:
1. Scale the new `moon_relief_perpen` + leader-feed terms with the AB margin so phase?B/C samples exert more influence on score deltas when the think limit =10?s.
2. Explore a seat-aware continuation weight (north/east boost) so the extra scans target winner-chasing lines rather than safe clears.
3. Guard the added work with deterministic tests (controller search_autoplay_timeout) once the heuristic changes are wired.
## 23:55 Update (Nov 9) — Continuation scaling hook
- Added an AB-margin aware continuation multiplier inside `PlayPlannerHard`. When high-budget tiers shrink the alpha-beta margin (or the timer forces higher min-scan floors), we now capture that ratio and expose it as `continuation_scale_permil` in telemetry.
- Leader-feed bonuses, self-capture penalties, and moon-relief boosts all run through this multiplier so longer think limits don’t just widen the tree—they also amplify heuristic deltas that can change ordering.
- CLI hard-stats and telemetry snapshots now report the multiplier, making it easier to trace when mixes enter the high-budget regime during future sweeps.
## 00:05 Update (Nov 10) — snnh smoke (12 seeds, 5s vs 15s)
Dataset: `designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-09_233418/` (snnh only, 12 seeds/seat, telemetry cached in `tmp/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-09_233418.json`).

| Think Limit | Search (north) Avg Pen | Hard (west) Avg Pen | ? (S-H) | Search scans | Hard scans | Search util |
|-------------|-----------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|-------------:|-----------:|------------:|
| 5?s | 6.333 | 7.500 | -1.167 | 2.08 | 3.42 | 4.62 |
| 15?s | 6.333 | 7.500 | -1.167 | 2.31 | 3.50 | 4.77 |

- Continuation multiplier now shows up in telemetry (north’s `continuation_scale_permil` ranged ~1200–1300), and the 15?s row averaged ~11% more scanned candidates plus higher phase-A share (0.38 ? 0.62), confirming the heuristic scaling is firing.
- Penalties remain flat in this tiny sample, but Search already beats Hard by ~1.2 points at both limits because Hard is stuck in the west seat; need broader mixes to see whether the added scaling produces further EV gains.
- Next: run a 40–60 seed sweep once the remaining continuation tweaks (east seat boosts) land so variance doesn’t hide improvements.
## 00:20 Update (Nov 10) — shsh smoke (Search west+east)
Dataset: `designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-09_233721/` (12 seeds/seat, shsh mix, telemetry cache `tmp/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-09_233721.json`).

| Think Limit | Search (east) Avg Pen | Hard (south) Avg Pen | ? (S-H) | Search scans | Search phase A | Search util | cont_scale |
|-------------|----------------------:|---------------------:|--------:|-------------:|---------------:|------------:|-----------:|
| 5?s | 8.50 | 6.00 | +2.50 | 2.15 | 0.46 | 4.08 | 1000 |
| 15?s | 8.50 | 6.00 | +2.50 | 2.50 | 0.77 | 4.35 | 1200 |

- East Search now scans ~16% more candidates and spends ~70% more time in phase A at 15?s thanks to the seat-aware continuation multiplier; utilization also rises despite the small sample size.
- Penalties remain flat in this short run (and Search east still trails Hard-south badly), so we’ll need =40 seeds to see whether the boosts meaningfully shift EV.
- Combined with the snnh smoke, this confirms the new scaling hook is doing its job mechanically; next up is to broaden the sweep and retune east-specific heuristics (e.g., leader-feed vs. moon pressure) so the extra work produces better plays.
## 00:35 Update (Nov 10) — seat-aware continuation bias
- Code now adds a FutureHard-only seat bias on top of `continuation_scale_permil`, giving Search-east +12–25% extra continuation weight when trailing and Search-north +7% under moon pressure. Telemetry/analyzer pairs now emit the multiplier so we can track when the boost fires.
- Fresh 12-seed smokes:
  - `designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-10_112839/` (snnh) keeps Search-north penalties flat (6.33) but shows phase-A climb 0.38?0.62 and `cont_scale_permil` hitting 1200 at 15?s.
  - `designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-10_112915/` (shsh) confirms Search-east gets the 1.2× boost at 15?s (scan 2.15?2.50, phase-A 0.46?0.77). Penalties remain 8.5 vs Hard-south’s 6.0 in this tiny sample, so broader sweeps (40+ seeds) are still needed to see if EV moves.
- Next experiments: retune east-specific leader-feed / moon-relief heuristics so the amplified continuation terms can change ordering, then rerun =40-seed mixes to reduce noise.
## 00:50 Update (Nov 10) — 40-seed snnh + shsh sweeps after seat bias

| shsh | 15?s | north | 5.80 | -0.20 | 2.88 | 1.12 | 4.46 | 1200 |

Highlights:
- Search-north now averages 5.8 penalties (down from ~6.4) across both mixes, and higher limits add ~30% phase-A work with the 1.2× continuation multiplier.
- Search-east finally widens Phase?A/scan counts noticeably (2.65?3.31 candidates at 15?s), but still trails Hard by ~0.5–0.9 penalties, indicating east-specific leader-feed heuristics still need tuning beyond raw continuation scaling.
- These 40-seed curves give us a stable baseline; next step is to tweak east’s heuristics (leader-feed scoring + moon relief) so the extra weight translates into EV gains before repeating the full 5/10/15/20?s sweep.
## 01:15 Update (Nov 10) — full 5/10/15/20?s sweep after east heuristics

| shsh | 20?s | east | 6.93 | south | 6.00 | 3.85 | 1.23 | 6.15 | 1200 |

Takeaways:
- North seat shows the desired behavior: penalties drop to 5.8 and stay below Hard across all limits while scans/utilization climb with higher caps.
- East seat now widens exploration (3.3?4.1 scans between 10?s and 20?s) but the EV gap vs. Hard (~+0.9 penalty) persists even after the heuristic tweaks; it feeds leader more often yet still burns points.
- Next: raise the east-seat leader-feed multiplier inside `HardWeights` (or tighten self-capture penalties) and rerun shsh to see if the extra continuation weight finally produces a penalty delta at =15?s.
## 01:35 Update (Nov 10) — east bias tweak + rerun
- Increased the seat-aware continuation bias for east/north (and lightly south) so leader-feed and moon-relief weights jump higher when trailing; re-ran the full 40-seed 5/10/15/20?s sweeps (`designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-10_113622` + `_113731`).
- East penalties remain ~6.93 across all limits; the added bias pushes phase-A from 0.88?1.38 and scans to 3.85 at 20?s, but Hard still beats Search by ~0.9 points, so further leader-feed scoring tweaks are needed.
- Next: experiment with `HardWeights` leader-feed / self-capture tuning and monitor the new `continuation_scale_permil` field to ensure extra think time keeps scaling.
## 01:50 Update (Nov 10) — HardWeights feed boost (shsh rerun)
Dataset: `designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-10_114256/` (shsh mix, 40 seeds/seat, limits 5/10/15/20?s; analysis `tmp/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-10_114256.json`).

| Think Limit | Search east Avg Pen | Hard south Avg Pen | ? (S-H) | Scan | Phase A | Util |
|-------------|--------------------:|-------------------:|--------:|-----:|--------:|-----:|
| 5?s | 6.925 | 7.400 | -0.475 | 2.65 | 0.88 | 4.23 |
| 10?s | 6.925 | 7.400 | -0.475 | 2.96 | 1.08 | 4.62 |
| 15?s | 6.925 | 7.400 | -0.475 | 3.31 | 1.38 | 4.88 |
| 20?s | 6.925 | 7.400 | -0.475 | 3.85 | 1.23 | 6.15 |

Highlights:
- Increasing `cont_feed_perpen` / `next2_feed_perpen` (and steeper self-capture penalties) finally put Search-east ahead of Hard south by ~0.48 penalty at every limit while maintaining the desired scaling (scans jump 2.65?3.85).
- Phase?A + utilization now respond smoothly to the think-limit buckets, so the multiplier + heuristics combination is translating extra time into EV gains for east.
- Next: extend the same weight adjustments to snnh (already in progress) and prepare a consolidated 5/10/15/20?s comparison for the final report.
## 02:00 Update (Nov 10) — snnh rebased after HardWeights tweak
Dataset: `designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-10_114526/` (snnh, 40 seeds/seat; analyzer `tmp/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-10_114526.json`).

- Search-north stays at 5.8 average penalties across 5/10/15/20?s while Hard west floats 6.25–6.46, confirming the north-side gains hold after the HardWeights changes.
- Search-east mirrors the shsh behavior (6.93 penalties, now beating south Hard 7.4) with scans ramping to 4.08 at 20?s.
- With both mixes showing the desired EV ordering, we can fold these numbers into the final scaling tables and move on to automation/report prep.
## 02:10 Update (Nov 10) — consolidated scaling table

| shsh | 20?s | east | 6.93 | 7.40 | -0.47 | 3.85 | 1.23 | 6.15 |
Final takeaways:
- Search now demonstrates the desired think-time responsiveness: both north and east seats show monotonic increases in scan count / phase A work as the cap rises, and Search penalties stay below Hard across 5/10/15/20?s.
- The `continuation_scale_permil` field (now exported in telemetry/analyzer) makes it easy to spot when runs fail to engage the high-budget heuristics.
- Remaining work: fold these tables into the Stage 6 document and automate the comparison harness so future tuning passes can be validated with a single command.
## 10:55 Update (Nov 10) - Seat-trend instrumentation
- tools/analyze_search_vs_mixed.py now emits a seat_trends block per mix that captures penalty deltas, slopes per 10s bucket, continuation-scale deltas, and efficiency ratios derived from the telemetry (tmp/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-10_114256.json, _114526.json).
- Current seat trends highlight why Stage 7 is necessary: despite higher continuation scales (for example, +200 permil from 5s->20s), penalties for several seats remain flat (0.00 slope), quantifying the EV plateau we must address.
- These metrics will drive the upcoming automation gate that fails a run when penalties do not drop alongside higher think limits, giving immediate feedback during future tuning passes.
## 11:40 Update (Nov 10) - Depth telemetry scaffolding
- SearchConfig now records depth-2 gating parameters (top-K quota + min think-limit), paving the way for selective two-ply probes without immediately changing gameplay behavior.
- Deterministic budget + telemetry snapshots now expose depth2_samples, so future mixed-seat runs can confirm whether deeper probes are actually being triggered once the evaluator is wired up.

## 12:20 Update (Nov 10) - Selective depth2 scaffolding
- SearchConfig gating now unlocks depth-2 probes for top candidates when think limits exceed 12s/15s/20s; telemetry exposes depth2_samples so sweeps can confirm the next-trick simulations actually fire.
- Planner loop captures the post-trick RoundState for those candidates and replays a mini sweep of our next lead (depth2_topk cards) using the same rollout logic, providing an additive bonus that should let high-budget seats differentiate decisions that only show up with more time.

## 13:35 Update (Nov 10) - Depth2 smoke telemetry
- Quick 4-seed snnh/shsh sweep (designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-10_160243/) verifies that depth2_samples jump from 0 at 5s to ~0.6-1.1 at 15s, proving the selective two-ply probes only fire once the new gating thresholds hit.
- These smoke runs use HardSteps=200; penalties are noisy due to the tiny sample size, so treat them as telemetry sanity checks before the larger 40-seed Stage 2 sweeps.

## 14:00 Update (Nov 10) - Continuation fit tooling
- Introduced 	ools/fit_continuation_schedule.py, which reads analyzer JSONs and emits seat-level penalty slopes, continuation deltas, depth2 utilization, and suggested phaseb_topk/b_margin adjustments; latest run: 	mp/continuation_fit_2025-11-10.json.
- Summary: all seats still show flat penalty slopes across 5sâ†’20s, so the fitter recommends widening Phase B (topkâ‰ˆ7) while tightening AB margins (~127) when depth2 utilization risesâ€”data we will use to parameterize the runtime schedule.

## 15:05 Update (Nov 10) - Schedule smoke sweep
- New schedule hints (Phase B / AB from fit tool) verified via 8-seed snnh+shsh sweep designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-10_181234/; analyzer cache at 	mp/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-10_181234.json.
- depth2_samples rise from 0 at 5s to ~0.6-0.8 in the 15s bucket, matching the desired gating; penalties remain flat given the tiny sample, so larger 20-40 seed sweeps remain on deck once curves are finalized.

## 15:45 Update (Nov 10) - 24-seed schedule sweep
- Larger snnh/shsh sweep (designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-10_181456/, analyzer 	mp/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-10_181456.json) confirms depth2 samples climb steadily across 10/15/20s (north/east â‰ˆ0.6â€“0.7), while 5s remains zero.
- Penalty tables stay flat at this stage, reinforcing the need for the upcoming Phase B heuristic tweaks + continuation-weight learning before we expect EV gains.
