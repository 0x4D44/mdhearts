# 2025.11.01 – JRN – CI eval workflow

## 12:25 – Manual eval workflow
- Added `.github/workflows/eval.yml` (workflow_dispatch) to run `tools/eval_all.sh` on Linux with flags ON and modest counts; uploads smoke/compare/summary artifacts.
- Added `docs/CI_EVAL.md` and linked from `README.md`.

## Next
- Optional: schedule a nightly on a fork with longer counts if desired.
