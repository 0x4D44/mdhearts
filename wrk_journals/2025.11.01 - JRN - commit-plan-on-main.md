# 2025.11.01 – JRN – commit plan on main

## 12:35 – Plan
- Added `designs/2025.11.01 - Commit Plan (Continue-On-Main).md` summarizing grouped commits for the feature‑flag path.
- Added `tools/commit_plan_on_main.sh` (DRY‑RUN by default; `RUN=1` to execute) to stage commits in logical groups without creating a branch.
- Annotated `designs/2025.10.30 - Branch Commit Plan.md` to reference the new continue‑on‑main plan.

## Next
- Optionally run `RUN=1 tools/commit_plan_on_main.sh` when ready to publish.
