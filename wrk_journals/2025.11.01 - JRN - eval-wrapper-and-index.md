# 2025.11.01 – JRN – eval wrapper + compare index

## 11:40 – Compare index + docs
- Added `tools/index_compare.sh` to summarize disagreement rows for compare CSVs; wrote `designs/tuning/stage1/compare_release/INDEX.md` (currently 0 rows across generated files).
- Added `docs/EVAL_WRAPPERS.md` and linked it from `README.md`.

## 11:50 – All-in-one eval
- `tools/eval_all.sh` orchestrates smokes → thresholds → compares (OFF/ON) → summary under `designs/tuning/eval_summaries/`.
- Ran a lightweight pass (counts small to limit runtime). Summary saved at `designs/tuning/eval_summaries/eval_2025-11-01_112533.md`.

## Next
- Increase compare counts opportunistically and watch for disagreements.
- Prepare a minimal fix for the ignored follow-up simulation test without changing game rules.
