# 2025.11.01 – JRN – nightly eval wrapper

## 12:05 – Nightly
- Added `tools/nightly_eval.sh` to run `eval_all.sh` with modest counts for a scheduled/nightly context.
- Added `designs/tuning/eval_summaries/README.md` documenting summary reports.
- Updated `docs/EVAL_WRAPPERS.md` to reference the nightly wrapper.

## Next
- Optional: add a scheduled GitHub Actions workflow to run nightly on a fork/CI with longer time budgets.
