# 2025.11.01 – JRN – Stage 1 README refresh

## 12:15 – Update
- Refreshed `designs/tuning/stage1/README.md` to reflect the `SMOKE_COUNT` parameter (default 2) and the `tools/smoke_fast.sh` workflow.
- Clarified manual invocation with `<mix>` and `<seed_start>`.

## Next
- If needed, add a short note about feature flags to the Stage 1 README, though the main README already covers flags.
