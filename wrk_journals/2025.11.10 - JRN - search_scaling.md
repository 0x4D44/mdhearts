# 2025-11-10 Journal - Search Scaling Continuation

## 09:20 - Repo reorientation after handoff
- Reloaded project context per prior plan (wrk_docs/2025.11.09 - PLN - search_continuation_scaling.md) and the tooling summary in wrk_docs/2025.11.07 - RPT - search_scaling_telemetry.md to make sure the Stage 6 runs and telemetry assets from 2025-11-10 remain the baseline for further work.
- Inspected crates/hearts-app/src/bot/search.rs and crates/hearts-app/src/bot/play.rs to refresh on how continuation multipliers, branch limits, and base heuristics currently operate at high think budgets.

## 09:35 - Improvement brainstorming setup
- Reviewed analyzer script (	ools/analyze_search_vs_mixed.py) to see what telemetry signals are already exposed for slope-based gating.
- Mapped touchpoints in crates/hearts-app/src/bot/search.rs (config scheduling, phase-B expansion logic, budget struct) where we can extend functionality without reworking the entire planner scaffold.

## 09:45 - Next actions
- Provide the user with ten concrete follow-up ideas that target the weak spots called out in the latest telemetry (flat EV vs higher think limits) and anchor each idea to specific files/sections for easier implementation triage.
- Pending user direction: promote the highest-value items into an updated plan doc and schedule the next batch of mixed-seat runs once new heuristics are prototyped.

## 10:10 - Idea ranking prep
- Reviewed the ten improvement ideas for feasibility vs expected EV lift, weighing how directly each change converts extra think time into better choices.
- Prioritized items that either deepen lookahead (two-ply), adapt continuation weights to live telemetry, or make heuristics data-driven, since these unblock the core plateau highlighted in wrk_docs/2025.11.07 - RPT - search_scaling_telemetry.md.

## 10:30 - Stage 7 plan drafted
- Authored wrk_docs/2025.11.10 - PLN - search_scaling_stage7.md, a multi-stage roadmap covering selective two-ply work, data-fit continuation scheduling, heuristic learning, validation automation, and rollout steps.
- Ensured the plan anchors each stage to concrete files (e.g., crates/hearts-app/src/bot/search.rs, 	ools/analyze_search_vs_mixed.py) plus telemetry/test deliverables so we can track progress against the Stage 6 baseline.

## 10:55 - Stage 0 instrumentation updates
- Inspected the latest mixed-seat analyzer outputs (	mp/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-10_114256.json and _114526.json) to confirm current penalties and continuation-scale readings per think limit.
- Extended 	ools/analyze_search_vs_mixed.py to add seat-level trend summaries (penalty deltas, slopes per 10s buckets, continuation-scale deltas, efficiency ratios) so future automation can evaluate whether additional think time actually improves EV.
- Regenerated the analyzer caches for the 2025-11-10_114256 (shsh) and 2025-11-10_114526 (snnh) sweeps, verifying the new seat_trends block captures the flat penalties that Stage 7 work must address.

## 11:15 - Stage 1 audit
- Reviewed crates/hearts-app/src/bot/search.rs to pinpoint insertion points for selective two-ply: SearchConfig::max_depth currently unused, and the planner loop only launches single-trick rollouts via ollout_current_trick.
- Identified Budget as the right place to track per-depth cost (already counts steps) and noted that per-candidate continuation happens inside the phase-B loop where we can branch to a deeper evaluation when new depth gates trigger.
- Confirmed the existing follow-up helpers (choose_followup_search*) already simulate future plays; we can reuse them for depth-2 probes by cloning the round once the current trick completes.

## 11:40 - Depth gating scaffolding
- Extended SearchConfig with depth2_topk/depth2_min_limit_ms so high-budget decisions can target a configurable quota of candidates for future two-ply probes; gating automatically scales with limit buckets and boosts north/east seats.
- Added depth2_samples tracking inside the deterministic Budget plus surfaced the counter through Stats and SearchTelemetrySnapshot, giving telemetry a placeholder for upcoming depth metrics without changing existing workflows.
- Ran cargo fmt to keep crates/hearts-app/src/bot/search.rs and crates/hearts-app/src/telemetry.rs consistent after the structural edits.

## 12:20 - Depth2 evaluator prototype
- Refactored the single-trick rollout to share a reusable TrickResolution helper (simulate_trick_resolution + continuation_from_resolution), enabling us to capture the post-trick state without duplicating logic.
- Added selective depth gating in the main planner loop (depth2_topk buckets) so the top candidates can request a captured resolution, then feed it into the new evaluate_depth2_bonus pass.
- Implemented the depth2 bonus as a mini two-ply sweep: when Search wins the trick and leads next, it reuses PlayPlanner::explain_candidates plus the same rollout machinery to score the next trick for up to depth2_topk leads, accumulating telemetry via depth2_samples.
- Formatted the updated sources with cargo fmt.
## 13:00 - Depth2 telemetry verification
- Re-ran the existing 2025-11-10_114256 shsh analyzer after depth2 wiring; stats currently show no depth2_samples yet because we have not regenerated runs with the new code.
- Confirmed seat_trends remains intact and exported the block to 	mp/depth2_summary_shsh.json for quick inspection while we prep the next mixed-seat sweep.
- Next: wire depth2-specific metrics into the analyzer + rerun targeted snnh/shsh smokes to verify the probes fire for north/east at >=12s limits.
## 13:15 - Analyzer depth2 hook
- Extended 	ools/analyze_search_vs_mixed.py so telemetry summaries capture depth2_samples; re-ran the latest shsh/snnh analyses (2025-11-10_114256/114526) to verify backward compatibility.
- Current datasets still show zero depth2 samples (expected, since we haven’t produced runs with the new selective-depth code yet); next sweeps should populate this field automatically.
## 13:35 - Depth2 smoke results
- Ran .\tools\run_search_vs_mixed.ps1 -Mixes snnh,shsh -ThinkLimitsMs @(5000,15000) with 4 seeds/seat to sanity-check the selective two-ply path; telemetry written under designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-10_160243/.
- Analyzer (	mp/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-10_160243.json) now shows depth2_samples > 0 once the 15s bucket kicks in (e.g., snnh north ~1.08 samples/decision, east ~0.8), while 5s caps stay at zero as expected.
- Penalties in this tiny run are noisy (e.g., Search-east 13.75 vs Hard-south 6.5 due to low N), but the telemetry confirms the gating logic is firing only for the high limits, clearing the way for larger Stage 2 sweeps.
## 14:00 - Stage 2 fitting script
- Added 	ools/fit_continuation_schedule.py, which ingests analyzer JSONs and emits mix/seat summaries (penalty slopes, continuation deltas, depth2 averages) plus suggested phaseb_topk / b_margin targets.
- Ran the tool across legacy + new smoke datasets (	mp/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-10_114256.json, _114526.json, _160243.json); output stored at 	mp/continuation_fit_2025-11-10.json for downstream schedule wiring.
- Early fit results highlight that every seat still has flat penalty slopes (<=0), so the script recommends widening Phase B (topk˜7) while shaving AB margins to ~127; we'll use these hints to drive the data-fit schedule in search.rs next.
## 14:20 - Schedule hints wired
- Introduced pply_schedule_hints in crates/hearts-app/src/bot/search.rs so Phase B width and AB margins now react to think-limit buckets, seat role, and whether depth2 probes are enabled (based on the gated config + limit remaining).
- This folds the recommendations from 	mp/continuation_fit_2025-11-10.json directly into runtime without hard-coding new env knobs; high-budget north/east seats will now automatically widen Phase B when depth2 is active while tightening AB margins.
- Ran cargo fmt after the changes; next step is to rerun snnh/shsh multi-limit sweeps to confirm penalty slopes respond to the new schedule.
## 15:05 - Schedule smoke validation
- Ran .\tools\run_search_vs_mixed.ps1 -Mixes snnh,shsh -Count*=8 -ThinkLimitsMs @(5000,10000,15000,20000) with the new schedule hints enabled (designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-10_181234/).
- Analyzer (	mp/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-10_181234.json) shows depth2 samples triggering across 10/15/20s buckets (e.g., snnh north 0.33?0.58, east 0.48?0.69) while 5s remains at 0, confirming the gating still behaves after the schedule changes.
- Penalties are noisy due to the small sample size; next step is to scale to 20–40 seeds once we incorporate the fitted phaseB/AB curves into the runtime defaults.
## 15:45 - 24-seed validation sweep
- Executed .\tools\run_search_vs_mixed.ps1 -Mixes snnh,shsh -Count*=24 -ThinkLimitsMs @(5000,10000,15000,20000) (designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-10_181456/); analyzer cache stored at 	mp/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-10_181456.json.
- Depth2 utilization now scales smoothly (e.g., snnh north 0.0?0.68 by 20s, east 0.0?0.71), proving the schedule hints + depth gate work under higher variance. Penalty slopes remain nearly flat, so Stage 3 will focus on further heuristic adjustments / continuation weight learning.
## 16:05 - Stage 3 heuristic tweak
- Updated seat_cont_bias to account for think-limit buckets and depth2 activation (north/east now push harder to feed leader at >=10s; self-capture bias relaxes when depth2 is enabled).
- Added pply_schedule_hints + new parameters throughout ollout_current_trick* so continuation evaluation knows the current limit and depth2 status; this lets deeper probes reuse the same biasing logic.
- Re-ran cargo fmt on crates/hearts-app/src/bot/search.rs; ready to validate the impact with another mixed-seat sweep.
## 18:40 - Stage 4 automation kickoff
- Power restored; reviewed wrk_docs/2025.11.10 - PLN - search_scaling_recovery.md and scoped the first actionable item: add failure gates to tools/analyze_search_vs_mixed.py so sweeps surface flat penalty slopes immediately.
- Plan for this block: 1) add slope-based goal checks (>= -0.15 when depth2_samples >= 0.4) + baseline sample guard, 2) emit mix/seat level `fails_goals` booleans in the JSON, 3) rerun analyzer on recent 2025-11-10 datasets to ensure backward compatibility, and 4) capture outputs plus next actions in the recovery plan.
- Dependencies noted: requires reusing seat_trends deltas from the existing payload; no new runs needed before coding.
## 19:05 - Analyzer gate implementation
- Added depth-aware trend tracking in tools/analyze_search_vs_mixed.py so each seat now records average depth2_samples, slope thresholds, and a `fails_goals` flag whenever selective two-ply is active (>=0.4 avg depth2) but penalties stay flat (slope >= -0.15 per 10s bucket).
- Regenerated the analyzer output for designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-10_181456/ and verified the new JSON (tmp/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-10_181456_recheck.json) includes the boolean gate plus supporting metadata; seats with true flags align with todays telemetry plateau.
- Next: fold these results into the recovery plan + report back so follow-up automation can consume the `fails_goals` signals.
## 19:12 - Automation prep
- Captured the analyzer gate status + helper requirements inside wrk_docs/2025.11.10 - PLN - search_scaling_recovery.md so the recovery plan now points at the bundle script deliverable.
- Next task: implement the helper (targeting tools/run_search_vs_mixed_bundle.ps1) that (a) shells out to run_search_vs_mixed.ps1 or reuses an existing sweep folder, (b) invokes tools/analyze_search_vs_mixed.py and tools/fit_continuation_schedule.py, and (c) drops markdown + JSON summaries under designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/<timestamp>/.
## 19:25 - Bundle helper + dry run
- Authored tools/run_search_vs_mixed_bundle.ps1 (wraps run_search_vs_mixed.ps1 + analyzer + fit tool, emits bundle/<analysis|continuation|summary>). Added options for SkipRuns/ExistingRoot so we can reuse prior sweeps while wiring automation.
- Smoke-tested via `powershell -File tools/run_search_vs_mixed_bundle.ps1 -SkipRuns -ExistingRoot designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-10_181456 -BundleName bundle_recheck`; summary shows 5/8 seats still failing the slope gate, matching expectations. Outputs stored under designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-10_181456/bundle_recheck/.
- Next steps: surface these summary artifacts in wrk_docs RPT + use them to drive future Stage 3 adjustments, then extend the helper to upload analyzer/fit JSONs into tmp/ (already copying) for quick comparison.
## 19:35 - Documentation sync kickoff
- Bundle helper + analyzer gate are in place; switching to documentation updates so Stage 3 tuning has a written record (RPT + plan refresh).
- Target deliverables: add a summary of 2025-11-10_181456 bundle_recheck (5/8 seats failing) to wrk_docs/2025.11.07 - RPT - search_scaling_telemetry.md, and annotate the recovery plan with a link/note pointing at the bundle artifacts.
- Once docs are aligned, we can schedule the next heuristic iteration without losing context.
## 19:45 - Stage 3 heuristic pass setup
- Bundle results pinpointed shsh south/west and snnh south/west/east as failing the slope gate; goal for this block is to tweak continuation heuristics so depth2 usage translates into EV drops.
- Plan: audit `seat_cont_bias` + `PlayPlanner::base_score` sections governing leader-feed vs self-capture when depth2 is active, note current limit-aware constants, then draft adjustments targeting trailing south/west seats.
- Will capture findings + proposals before touching code so we can iterate quickly with the new bundle helper.
## 19:55 - seat_cont_bias fix + boost
- Reconstructed `PlayPlannerHard::seat_cont_bias` after spotting corruption (bad patch text was sitting where the tuple return should be). The new version restores compilable code and adds targeted boosts for south/west seats, larger trail-gap multipliers, and high-limit/depth2 adjustments so selective two-ply decisions bias harder toward leader-feed outcomes.
- Key knobs: trail steps add +90 feed / -60 self per 3-point gap, south/west get extra +120 feed plus limit-aware surcharges, and moon pressure now bumps the scaling + depth2 stacks another +150 feed / -100 self.
- Next: rerun the analyzer bundle on the existing sweep to ensure JSON generation works again, then schedule a fresh snnh/shsh smoke with the helper to see if any `fails_goals` flip.
## 20:05 - Post-bias validation plan
- With seat_cont_bias restored/tuned, need to re-run the bundle helper on the latest sweep to confirm analyzer/fitter paths still succeed, then queue a fresh snnh+shsh run (target 12-seat×40 seeds) once we're confident the baseline artifacts generate cleanly.
- Immediate action: reuse the 2025-11-10_181456 sweep via tools/run_search_vs_mixed_bundle.ps1 and inspect summary deltas; log anything notable before deciding whether another full sweep is warranted tonight.
## 20:15 - Stage 3 sweep kickoff
- Ready to test the new seat bias: running fresh snnh+shsh sweeps (40 seeds/seat, think limits 5/10/15/20s, deterministic Hard steps 200) so we can re-evaluate `fails_goals` with the actual code changes.
- Command: `pwsh tools/run_search_vs_mixed.ps1 -Mixes snnh,shsh -Count*=40 -ThinkLimitsMs @(5000,10000,15000,20000) -TelemetryOut -IncludeStats` (PowerShell version via powershell.exe here).
- Once runs finish, will wrap them with the bundle helper and compare slopes vs the pre-bias sweep.
## 20:25 - RPT update prep
- New sweep (2025-11-10_201725) shows fails_goals dropping to 4/8 seats (west seats cleared, north/east now the bottleneck). Need to capture this in wrk_docs/2025.11.07 - RPT - search_scaling_telemetry.md plus outline north/east heuristic adjustments.
- Next steps for this block: append a summary/table to the RPT referencing the bundle artifacts, then map the north/east hotspots in search.rs/play.rs before coding changes.
## 20:35 - North/East tuning focus
- Latest bundle (2025-11-10_201725) leaves shsh north/south and snnh east/north failing; south already has stronger feed bias, so next tweaks target north/east (leader-feed boost when trailing + limit-aware scaling in base_score).
- Tasks: 1) extend `seat_cont_bias` so north gets depth2-based feed bonuses similar to south/west, and east gains stronger scaling when high-limit depth2 triggers; 2) mirror those tweaks inside `PlayPlanner::base_score` so heuristic ordering aligns.
## 20:45 - Post-adjustment sweep kickoff
- With north/east biases updated, rerunning the full snnh+shsh sweep (40 seeds/seat, think limits 5/10/15/20s, HardSteps=200, telemetry/stats on) to verify slope gates.
- Same command as before (script invocation inside powershell.exe). Once complete, will bundle/analyze immediately.
## 20:55 - Sweep + bundle results
- Sweep `designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-10_202248/` finished with new heuristics; bundle summary shows fails_goals stuck at 4/8 seats, but north slopes now slightly negative (-0.067) while south now passes in snnh. East still flat, so next tweak is continuing leader-feed emphasis + potential continuation scaling adjustments.
## 21:05 - Doc + east tuning plan
- Sweep 2025-11-10_202248 keeps fails at 4/8; north slopes dipped slightly negative but not enough, east still flat. Need to document this run + plan a continuation-scale tweak for east/north.
- Next steps: update wrk_docs/2025.11.07 - RPT with the new bundle stats, then outline the code touchpoints for scale adjustments (seat_cont_bias + continuation_scale_permil / apply_schedule_hints).
## 21:15 - Continuation scaling tweaks
- To unblock east/north slopes, going to raise their continuation_scale_permil + schedule hints when trailing at >=10s and depth2 fires, so deeper probes get more weight.
- Scope: modify `continuation_scale_permil` seat bonuses + `apply_schedule_hints` to widen phaseB for east/north at higher limits.
## 21:25 - Continuation scaling sweep kickoff
- With the east/north continuation scale + schedule boosts applied, rerunning the full snnh+shsh sweep (40 seeds/seat, 5/10/15/20s, HardSteps=200, telemetry/stats on) to measure slope impact.
## 22:00 - Sweep completion note
- run_search_vs_mixed.ps1 timed out in the CLI after ~62 minutes, but checking designs/tuning/search_vs_mixed/2025-11-10_202735/ shows the run actually finished (snnh+shsh folders with all limit buckets + telemetry). Proceeding with analyzer bundle.
## 22:05 - SNnH focus plan
- Latest bundle (2025-11-10_202735) reduced fails to 2/8 (snnh east/north only). Need to document results in RPT and plan snnh-specific tweaks (mix-aware schedule + HardWeights).
## 22:10 - SNnH mix-aware scaling plan
- Remaining fails are snnh east/north, so next change: make continuation scaling + phaseB hints mix-aware (more aggressive when mix tag == snnh and depth2 is running).
- Approach: thread mix label from evaluation limits (or new env) into search config; simpler path is to detect mix via DecisionLimit metadata? If unavailable, temporarily use env `MDH_SEARCH_MIX_HINT` before each sweep (run script can set). Will start by adding optional mix hint (env) in search.rs to bias scaling accordingly.
## 22:15 - Mix-aware sweep kickoff
- Running snnh+shsh sweep again with the new `MDH_SEARCH_MIX_HINT` wiring (script now sets the env per seat). Same parameters: 40 seeds/seat, limits 5/10/15/20s, HardSteps=200, telemetry/stats on.
## 22:25 - Mix-aware sweep results
- Sweep 2025-11-10_213441 completed; bundle shows fails back to 4/8 (shsh north/south regressed). SNnH tweaks helped east slightly (depth2 still 0.5, slope flat), but removing the mix hint for shsh might undo prior gains. Need to gate mix hint per run instead of global env.
## 22:30 - Mix hint fix plan
- Previous run set MDH_SEARCH_MIX_HINT for both snnh and shsh, regressing shsh slopes. Plan: only set the env for SNnH mixes (leave shsh blank) and rerun the sweep.
## 22:40 - Mix hint rollback plan
- Mix hint approach is hurting shsh and not helping snnh; plan to revert the env-based mix detection and return to per-seat tuning via heuristics.
## 22:50 - Regression hunt plan
- Need to regain the 2/8 pass state from sweep 2025-11-10_202735. Next step: diff current code vs that snapshot to see which continuation/bias changes happened since then, isolate the culprit, and retest.
## 22:55 - Diff plan
- To diagnose the regression, going to diff current code vs the version used for sweep 2025-11-10_202735 (the last 2/8 success) and note changes in seat biases/continuation scaling.
## 23:05 - Post-rollback sweep results
- Reverting mix-aware scaling + rerunning produced sweep 2025-11-10_221406 (fails now 3/8: shsh south + snnh east/north). Good: shsh north re-cleared. Need next tweaks targeting shsh south and SNnH east/north.
## 23:10 - Diff target
- Need commit hash from sweep 2025-11-10_202735; plan is to inspect git reflog/notes to find it then diff search.rs/play.rs.
## 23:20 - Revert scaling block
- To recover the 2/8 pass state, reverting the continuation scale seat bonus back to the earlier fixed values (no limit/depth2 multipliers); then rerun the sweep.
## 23:25 - Fixed scaling rerun
- Reverted seat bonus scaling to the earlier version, reran sweep (2025-11-10_221818). Result still 4/8 fails (same seats), meaning other changes (seat bias or schedule) are responsible for shsh south + snnh east/north regressions.
## 23:35 - Regression diff kickoff
- Fails stuck at shsh south + snnh east/north; going to diff `crates/hearts-app/src/bot/search.rs` and `play.rs` against the commit used for sweep 2025-11-10_202735 (git show HEAD~3) to isolate changes in seat bias and scheduling.
## 23:40 - Reverting seat_cont_bias
- Diff shows the big change since the 2/8 sweep is the new seat_cont_bias + plumbing. Plan: restore the earlier version (pre-depth2 rewrite) and rerun the sweep to confirm slopes recover.
## 23:45 - Simplifying seat biases
- Since the new seat_cont_bias logic coincides with the regression, reverting to a simpler heuristic (mostly neutral) to match the earlier behavior, then rerun sweep.
## 23:50 - Simple bias sweep kickoff
- With seat_cont_bias reverted to the simpler version, rerunning snnh+shsh sweep (40 seeds/seat, think limits 5/10/15/20s, HardSteps=200, telemetry/stats) to confirm slopes.
## 23:55 - Next suspects
- Simple seat_cont_bias didn’t fix slopes; next regression suspects are `apply_schedule_hints` and the east/north heuristics in `PlayPlanner::base_score`. Will diff vs the passing commit, adjust, then sweep again.
## 00:05 - Reverting schedule hints
- Diff shows apply_schedule_hints still has the extra depth2 boosts; reverting it to the earlier behavior (no seat-specific depth2 boosts). Will rerun sweep afterward.
## 00:15 - Schedule revert sweep
- Reverted apply_schedule_hints to the earlier version and reran sweep (2025-11-11_171833); fails still 4/8, identical to the last run. Remaining culprits are base_score heuristics (east/north biases) and possibly broader continuation scaling. Need to target those next.
## 00:25 - Base_score focus
- With schedule biases reverted, next step is PlayPlanner::base_score (east/north heuristics). Will compare against the earlier sweeping commit and roll back the extra limit-based boosts that might be keeping slopes flat.
## 00:30 - base_score revert applied
- Removed the limit-based east/north block and extra leader-feed boost from PlayPlanner::base_score; reverted to weight-driven behavior. Running sweep next.
## 00:40 - Base_score revert sweep
- After reverting base_score east/north boosts, sweep (2025-11-11_172737) still shows 4/8 fails, but slopes flattened to 0 (no negative progress). Need targeted positive adjustments (e.g., HardWeights/continuation scaling). Will report current state and consider more drastic changes tomorrow.
## 00:50 - Weight tuning plan
- Heuristic rollbacks still leave slopes flat; next step is to tweak HardWeights/continuation caps (leader_feed_base, nonleader_feed_perpen, etc.) for shsh south + snnh east/north, likely via env overrides per sweep.
## 01:00 - Weight tweak
- Adjusting Hard weight defaults (leader_feed_base/gap, nonleader feed penalty) to push Search seats to feed leaders when trailing; rerunning sweep afterwards.
## 01:15 - Weight tweak sweep
- Changed Hard weight defaults (leader feed + gap, lower nonleader penalty) and reran sweep (2025-11-11_173126); fails remain 4/8 and shsh north slope flipped positive. Conclusion: aggressive feed weights alone aren’t solving the plateau; need more targeted changes (maybe mix-specific env overrides or data-driven tables). Will revert weights for now before proceeding.
## 01:20 - Reverted weight tweak
- Reverted Hard weight defaults to 800/120/1200/40 after sweep showed no improvement. Next actions TBD (may explore mix-specific tables or telemetry-driven continuation). Current failing seats: shsh north/south, snnh east/north.
## 01:25 - Telemetry delta plan
- Since code rollbacks didn’t restore 2/8 success, next move is to compare telemetry from the passing sweep (2025-11-10_202735) against the latest bundles, focusing on depth2/continuation metrics for SNnH east/north and shsh south, then design mix-specific adjustments.
## 01:35 - Telemetry comparison
- Ran analyzer on passing sweep (2025-11-10_202735) vs current (2025-11-11_172737): failing seats now show lower scan counts/phase-A utilization (~3.6 vs 3.8) and no depth2 samples despite same limits. Suggests depth2 gating isn’t firing or data measurement changed. Plan: instrument run logs to confirm depth2 firing and possibly force depth2_topk for SNnH east/north.
