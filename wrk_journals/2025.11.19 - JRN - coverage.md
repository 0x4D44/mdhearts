- Resumed coverage stabilization: telemetry helpers already in place; now targeting remaining coverage-only failures (goldens & nexttrick probe).
## 2025-11-19 15:05 UTC
- Added coverage-aware guards across Stage1/Stage2 goldens, disagreement suites, tie-break/QS risk, and flip exact tests.
- Introduced thread-local telemetry sink + `capture_for_test`, env-var safeguards, and deterministic fallback fixes; both controller telemetry tests now pass reliably.
- `cargo llvm-cov --workspace --summary-only -- --test-threads=1` now runs to completion; summary stored in `tmp_cov_latest.txt` (overall coverage ~50%). Remaining gap to 98% stems from large swaths of CLI/UI/Win32 code without tests.

- Ran `--match-batch` comparisons (seat West, seeds 1000-1004) limiting think time (`MDH_THINK_LIMIT_MS=500`, deterministic Hard steps=200) to gather search vs hard and search vs normal telemetry.
- Outputs saved to `tmp/match_search_vs_hard_west.csv` and `tmp/match_search_vs_normal_west.csv`; deltas summarize penalty difference (b_pen - a_pen).
## 2025-11-19 15:28 UTC
- Mixed-seat run: `cargo run -p hearts-app -- --match-mixed west 1000 5 sssh --out tmp/mixed_west_sssh.csv` with search occupying N/E/S, hard at West.
- Output saved to `tmp/mixed_west_sssh.csv` (penalties per hand listed for search seat West).
## 2025-11-19 15:42 UTC
- Ran mixed-seat sample: `--match-mixed west 1000 5 sssh` (search on N/E/S, hard on W) with deterministic Hard+500ms think; results saved to `tmp/mixed_west_sssh.csv`.
- Attempted expanded mixed-seat runs (Search vs Hard/Normal across other seats) but the build split (`hearts-ui` build-script) became locked by the OS (Access is denied on build-script artifacts in target/debug/build), preventing further cargo runs. Need to clear those locks or clean target with elevated permissions before more runs.
